The Go connector uses your Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authorize your connection to AlloyDB.\nIn addition to setting the ADC for your server, you need to ensure the IAM identity has been given the following IAM roles (or corresponding permissions):\nroles/alloydb.client roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer Networking AlloyDB supports connecting over both from external networks via the internet (public IP), and internal networks (private IP). For more information on choosing between the two options, see the AlloyDB page Connection overview.\nYou can configure the ipType parameter in your source configuration to public or private to match your cluster’s configuration. Regardless of which you choose, all connections use IAM-based authorization and are encrypted with mTLS.\nAuthentication This source supports both password-based authentication and IAM authentication (using your Application Default Credentials).\nStandard Authentication To connect using user/password, create a PostgreSQL user and input your credentials in the user and password fields.\nuser: ${USER_NAME} password: ${PASSWORD} IAM Authentication To connect using IAM authentication:\nPrepare your database instance and user following this guide. You could choose one of the two ways to log in: Specify your IAM email as the user. Leave your user field blank. Toolbox will fetch the ADC automatically and log in using the email associated with it. Leave the password field blank. Example sources: my-alloydb-pg-source: kind: alloydb-postgres project: my-project-id region: us-central1 cluster: my-cluster instance: my-instance database: my_db user: ${USER_NAME} password: ${PASSWORD} # ipType: \"public\" Tip\nUse environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME} instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.\nReference field type required description kind string true Must be “alloydb-postgres”. project string true Id of the GCP project that the cluster was created in (e.g. “my-project-id”). region string true Name of the GCP region that the cluster was created in (e.g. “us-central1”). cluster string true Name of the AlloyDB cluster (e.g. “my-cluster”). instance string true Name of the AlloyDB instance within the cluster (e.g. “my-instance”). database string true Name of the Postgres database to connect to (e.g. “my_db”). user string false Name of the Postgres user to connect as (e.g. “my-pg-user”). Defaults to IAM auth using ADC email if unspecified. password string false Password of the Postgres user (e.g. “my-password”).

Natural language streamlines the development of generative AI applications by transferring the complexity of converting natural language to SQL from the application layer to the database layer.\nThis tool is compatible with the following sources:\nalloydb-postgres AlloyDB AI Natural Language delivers secure and accurate responses for application end user natural language questions. Natural language streamlines the development of generative AI applications by transferring the complexity of converting natural language to SQL from the application layer to the database layer.\nRequirements Tip\nAlloyDB AI natural language is currently in gated public preview. For more information on availability and limitations, please see AlloyDB AI natural language overview\nTo enable AlloyDB AI natural language for your AlloyDB cluster, please follow the steps listed in the Generate SQL queries that answer natural language questions, including enabling the extension and configuring context for your application.\nNote\nAs of AlloyDB AI NL v1.0.3+, the signature of execute_nl_query has been updated. Run SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'alloydb_ai_nl'; to check which version your instance is using. AlloyDB AI NL v1.0.3+ is required for Toolbox v0.19.0+. Starting with Toolbox v0.19.0, users who previously used the create_configuration operation for the natural language configuration must update it. To do so, please drop the existing configuration and redefine it using the instructions here.\nConfiguration Specifying an nl_config A nl_config is a configuration that associates an application to schema objects, examples and other contexts that can be used. A large application can also use different configurations for different parts of the app, as long as the correct configuration can be specified when a question is sent from that part of the application.\nOnce you’ve followed the steps for configuring context, you can use the context field when configuring a alloydb-ai-nl tool. When this tool is invoked, the SQL will be generated and executed using this context.\nSpecifying Parameters to PSV’s Parameterized Secure Views (PSVs) are a feature unique to AlloyDB that allows you to require one or more named parameter values passed to the view when querying it, somewhat like bind variables with ordinary database queries.\nYou can use the nlConfigParameters to list the parameters required for your nl_config. You must supply all parameters required for all PSVs in the context. It’s strongly recommended to use features like Authenticated Parameters or Bound Parameters to provide secure access to queries generated using natural language, as these parameters are not visible to the LLM.\nTip\nMake sure to enable the parameterized_views extension before running this tool. You can do so by running this command in the AlloyDB studio:\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS parameterized_views; Example tools: ask_questions: kind: alloydb-ai-nl source: my-alloydb-source description: \"Ask questions to check information about flights\" nlConfig: \"cymbal_air_nl_config\" nlConfigParameters: - name: user_email type: string description: User ID of the logged in user. # note: we strongly recommend using features like Authenticated or # Bound parameters to prevent the LLM from seeing these params and # specifying values it shouldn't in the tool input authServices: - name: my_google_service field: email Reference field type required description kind string true Must be “alloydb-ai-nl”. source string true Name of the AlloyDB source the natural language query should execute on. description string true Description of the tool that is passed to the LLM. nlConfig string true The name of the nl_config in AlloyDB nlConfigParameters parameters true List of PSV parameters defined in the nl_config ","categories":"","description":"The \"alloydb-ai-nl\" tool leverages [AlloyDB AI](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/ai) next-generation Natural Language support to provide the ability to query the database directly using natural language.\n","excerpt":"The \"alloydb-ai-nl\" tool leverages [AlloyDB …","ref":"/genai-toolbox/dev/resources/tools/alloydbainl/alloydb-ai-nl/","tags":"","title":"alloydb-ai-nl"},{"body":"About The alloydb-create-cluster tool creates a new AlloyDB for PostgreSQL cluster in a specified project and location.

It can primarily be used by Tools in two different ways:\nAuthorized Invocation is when a tool is validated by the auth service before the call can be invoked. Toolbox will reject any calls that fail to validate or have an invalid token. Authenticated Parameters replace the value of a parameter with a field from an OIDC claim. Toolbox will automatically resolve the ID token provided by the client and replace the parameter in the tool call. Example The following configurations are placed at the top level of a tools.yaml file.\nTip\nIf you are accessing Toolbox with multiple applications, each application should register their own Client ID even if they use the same “kind” of auth provider.\nauthServices: my_auth_app_1: kind: google clientId: ${YOUR_CLIENT_ID_1} my_auth_app_2: kind: google clientId: ${YOUR_CLIENT_ID_2} Tip\nUse environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME} instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.\nAfter you’ve configured an authService you’ll, need to reference it in the configuration for each tool that should use it:\nAuthorized Invocations for authorizing a tool call, use the authRequired field in a tool config Authenticated Parameters for using the value from a OIDC claim, use the authServices field in a parameter config Specifying ID Tokens from Clients After configuring your authServices section, use a Toolbox SDK to add your ID tokens to the header of a Tool invocation request. When specifying a token you will provide a function (that returns an id). This function is called when the tool is invoked. This allows you to cache and refresh the ID token as needed.\nThe primary method for providing these getters is via the auth_token_getters parameter when loading tools, or the add_auth_token_getter() / add_auth_token_getters() methods on a loaded tool object.\nSpecifying tokens during load Python Use the Python SDK.\nCore LangChain Llamaindex import asyncio from toolbox_core import ToolboxClient async def get_auth_token(): # ...

With BigQuery, there’s no infrastructure to set up or manage, letting you focus on finding meaningful insights using GoogleSQL and taking advantage of flexible pricing models across on-demand and flat-rate options.\nIf you are new to BigQuery, you can try to load and query data with the bq tool.\nBigQuery uses GoogleSQL for querying data. GoogleSQL is an ANSI-compliant structured query language (SQL) that is also implemented for other Google Cloud services. SQL queries are handled by cluster nodes in the same way as NoSQL data requests. Therefore, the same best practices apply when creating SQL queries to run against your BigQuery data, such as avoiding full table scans or complex filters.\nAvailable Tools bigquery-analyze-contribution Performs contribution analysis, also called key driver analysis in BigQuery.\nbigquery-conversational-analytics Allows conversational interaction with a BigQuery source.\nbigquery-execute-sql\nExecute structured queries using parameters.\nbigquery-forecast Forecasts time series data in BigQuery.\nbigquery-get-dataset-info\nRetrieve metadata for a specific dataset.\nbigquery-get-table-info\nRetrieve metadata for a specific table.\nbigquery-list-dataset-ids\nList available dataset IDs.\nbigquery-list-table-ids\nList tables in a given dataset.\nbigquery-sql\nRun SQL queries directly against BigQuery datasets.\nbigquery-search-catalog List all entries in Dataplex Catalog (e.g. tables, views, models) that matches given user query.\nPre-built Configurations BigQuery using MCP Connect your IDE to BigQuery using Toolbox. Requirements IAM Permissions BigQuery uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control user and group access to BigQuery resources like projects, datasets, and tables.\nAuthentication via Application Default Credentials (ADC) By default, Toolbox will use your Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authorize and authenticate when interacting with BigQuery.\nWhen using this method, you need to ensure the IAM identity associated with your ADC (such as a service account) has the correct permissions for the queries you intend to run. Common roles include roles/bigquery.user (which includes permissions to run jobs and read data) or roles/bigbigquery.dataViewer. Follow this guide to set up your ADC.\nAuthentication via User’s OAuth Access Token If the useClientOAuth parameter is set to true, Toolbox will instead use the OAuth access token for authentication. This token is parsed from the Authorization header passed in with the tool invocation request. This method allows Toolbox to make queries to BigQuery on behalf of the client or the end-user.\nWhen using this on-behalf-of authentication, you must ensure that the identity used has been granted the correct IAM permissions.\nExample Initialize a BigQuery source that uses ADC:\nsources: my-bigquery-source: kind: \"bigquery\" project: \"my-project-id\" # location: \"US\" # Optional: Specifies the location for query jobs. # writeMode: \"allowed\" # One of: allowed, blocked, protected.

This location must match the location of any tables referenced in the query. Defaults to the table’s location or ‘US’ if the location cannot be determined. Learn More writeMode string false Controls the write behavior for tools. allowed (default): All queries are permitted. blocked: Only SELECT statements are allowed for the bigquery-execute-sql tool. protected: Enables session-based execution where all tools associated with this source instance share the same BigQuery session. This allows for stateful operations using temporary tables (e.g., CREATE TEMP TABLE). For bigquery-execute-sql, SELECT statements can be used on all tables, but write operations are restricted to the session’s temporary dataset. For tools like bigquery-sql, bigquery-forecast, and bigquery-analyze-contribution, the writeMode restrictions do not apply, but they will operate within the shared session. Note: The protected mode cannot be used with useClientOAuth: true. It is also not recommended for multi-user server environments, as all users would share the same session. A session is terminated automatically after 24 hours of inactivity or after 7 days, whichever comes first. A new session is created on the next request, and any temporary data from the previous session will be lost. allowedDatasets []string false An optional list of dataset IDs that tools using this source are allowed to access. If provided, any tool operation attempting to access a dataset not in this list will be rejected. To enforce this, two types of operations are also disallowed: 1) Dataset-level operations (e.g., CREATE SCHEMA), and 2) operations where table access cannot be statically analyzed (e.g., EXECUTE IMMEDIATE, CREATE PROCEDURE). If a single dataset is provided, it will be treated as the default for prebuilt tools. useClientOAuth bool false If true, forwards the client’s OAuth access token from the “Authorization” header to downstream queries. Note: This cannot be used with writeMode: protected. impersonateServiceAccount string false Service account email to impersonate when making BigQuery and Dataplex API calls. The authenticated principal must have the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on the target service account.

It supports healthcare data standards such as HL7® FHIR®, HL7® v2, and DICOM®. It provides a fully managed, highly scalable, enterprise-grade development environment for building clinical and analytics solutions securely on Google Cloud.\nA dataset is a container in your Google Cloud project that holds modality-specific healthcare data. Datasets contain other data stores, such as FHIR stores and DICOM stores, which in turn hold their own types of healthcare data.\nA single dataset can contain one or many data stores, and those stores can all service the same modality or different modalities as application needs dictate. Using multiple stores in the same dataset might be appropriate in various situations.\nIf you are new to the Cloud Healthcare API, you can try to create and view datasets and stores using curl.\nAvailable Tools cloud-healthcare-get-dataset Retrieves a dataset’s details.\ncloud-healthcare-list-fhir-stores Lists the available FHIR stores in the healthcare dataset.\ncloud-healthcare-list-dicom-stores Lists the available DICOM stores in the healthcare dataset.\ncloud-healthcare-get-fhir-store Retrieves information about a FHIR store.\ncloud-healthcare-get-fhir-store-metrics Retrieves metrics for a FHIR store.\ncloud-healthcare-get-fhir-resource Retrieves a specific FHIR resource from a FHIR store.\ncloud-healthcare-fhir-patient-search Searches for patients in a FHIR store based on a set of criteria.\ncloud-healthcare-fhir-patient-everything Retrieves all information for a given patient.\ncloud-healthcare-fhir-fetch-page Fetches a page of FHIR resources from a given URL.\ncloud-healthcare-get-dicom-store Retrieves information about a DICOM store.\ncloud-healthcare-get-dicom-store-metrics Retrieves metrics for a DICOM store.\ncloud-healthcare-search-dicom-studies Searches for DICOM studies in a DICOM store.\ncloud-healthcare-search-dicom-series Searches for DICOM series in a DICOM store.\ncloud-healthcare-search-dicom-instances Searches for DICOM instances in a DICOM store.\ncloud-healthcare-retrieve-rendered-dicom-instance Retrieves a rendered DICOM instance from a DICOM store.\nRequirements IAM Permissions The Cloud Healthcare API uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control user and group access to Cloud Healthcare resources like projects, datasets, and stores.\nAuthentication via Application Default Credentials (ADC) By default, Toolbox will use your Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authorize and authenticate when interacting with the Cloud Healthcare API.\nWhen using this method, you need to ensure the IAM identity associated with your ADC (such as a service account) has the correct permissions for the queries you intend to run. Common roles include roles/healthcare.fhirResourceReader (which includes permissions to read and search for FHIR resources) or roles/healthcare.dicomViewer (for retrieving DICOM images). Follow this guide to set up your ADC.\nAuthentication via User’s OAuth Access Token If the useClientOAuth parameter is set to true, Toolbox will instead use the OAuth access token for authentication. This token is parsed from the Authorization header passed in with the tool invocation request. This method allows Toolbox to make queries to the Cloud Healthcare API on behalf of the client or the end-user.\nWhen using this on-behalf-of authentication, you must ensure that the identity used has been granted the correct IAM permissions.\nExample Initialize a Cloud Healthcare API source that uses ADC:\nsources: my-healthcare-source: kind: \"cloud-healthcare\" project: \"my-project-id\" region: \"us-central1\" dataset: \"my-healthcare-dataset-id\" # allowedFhirStores: # Optional: Restricts tool access to a specific list of FHIR store IDs. # - \"my_fhir_store_1\" # allowedDicomStores: # Optional: Restricts tool access to a specific list of DICOM store IDs. # - \"my_dicom_store_1\" # - \"my_dicom_store_2\" Initialize a Cloud Healthcare API source that uses the client’s access token:\nsources: my-healthcare-client-auth-source: kind: \"cloud-healthcare\" project: \"my-project-id\" region: \"us-central1\" dataset: \"my-healthcare-dataset-id\" useClientOAuth: true # allowedFhirStores: # Optional: Restricts tool access to a specific list of FHIR store IDs. # - \"my_fhir_store_1\" # allowedDicomStores: # Optional: Restricts tool access to a specific list of DICOM store IDs. # - \"my_dicom_store_1\" # - \"my_dicom_store_2\" Reference field type required description kind string true Must be “cloud-healthcare”. project string true ID of the GCP project that the dataset lives in. region string true Specifies the region (e.g., ‘us’, ‘asia-northeast1’) of the healthcare dataset.

Dataplex Universal Catalog powers AI, analytics, and business intelligence at scale.\nAt the heart of these governance capabilities is a catalog that contains a centralized inventory of the data assets in your organization. Dataplex Universal Catalog holds business, technical, and runtime metadata for all of your data. It helps you discover relationships and semantics in the metadata by applying artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nExample sources: my-dataplex-source: kind: \"dataplex\" project: \"my-project-id\" Sample System Prompt You can use the following system prompt as “Custom Instructions” in your client application.\n# Objective Your primary objective is to help discover, organize and manage metadata related to data assets. # Tone and Style 1. Adopt the persona of a senior subject matter expert 2. Your communication style must be: 1. Concise: Always favor brevity. 2. Direct: Avoid greetings (e.g., \"Hi there!\", \"Certainly!\"). Get straight to the point. Example (Incorrect): Hi there! I see that you are looking for... Example (Correct): This problem likely stems from... 3. Do not reiterate or summarize the question in the answer. 4. Crucially, always convey a tone of uncertainty and caution. Since you are interpreting metadata and have no way to externally verify your answers, never express complete confidence. Frame your responses as interpretations based solely on the provided metadata. Use a suggestive tone, not a prescriptive one: Example (Correct): \"The entry describes...\" Example (Correct): \"According to catalog,...\" Example (Correct): \"Based on the metadata,...\" Example (Correct): \"Based on the search results,...\" 5. Do not make assumptions # Data Model ## Entries Entry represents a specific data asset. Entry acts as a metadata record for something that is managed by Catalog, such as: - A BigQuery table or dataset - A Cloud Storage bucket or folder - An on-premises SQL table ## Aspects While the Entry itself is a container, the rich descriptive information about the asset (e.g., schema, data types, business descriptions, classifications) is stored in associated components called Aspects. Aspects are created based on pre-defined blueprints known as Aspect Types. ## Aspect Types Aspect Type is a reusable template that defines the schema for a set of metadata fields. Think of an Aspect Type as a structure for the kind of metadata that is organized in the catalog within the Entry.

An Entry Group acts as a namespace for its Entries. ## Entry Links Entries can be linked together using EntryLinks to represent relationships between data assets (e.g. foreign keys). # Tool instructions ## Tool: dataplex_search_entries ## General - Do not try to search within search results on your own. - Do not fetch multiple pages of results unless explicitly asked. ## Search syntax ### Simple search In its simplest form, a search query consists of a single predicate. Such a predicate can match several pieces of metadata: - A substring of a name, display name, or description of a resource - A substring of the type of a resource - A substring of a column name (or nested column name) in the schema of a resource - A substring of a project ID - A string from an overview description For example, the predicate foo matches the following resources: - Resource with the name foo.bar - Resource with the display name Foo Bar - Resource with the description This is the foo script - Resource with the exact type foo - Column foo_bar in the schema of a resource - Nested column foo_bar in the schema of a resource - Project prod-foo-bar - Resource with an overview containing the word foo ### Qualified predicates You can qualify a predicate by prefixing it with a key that restricts the matching to a specific piece of metadata: - An equal sign (=) restricts the search to an exact match. - A colon (:) after the key matches the predicate to either a substring or a token within the value in the search results. Tokenization splits the stream of text into a series of tokens, with each token usually corresponding to a single word. For example: - name:foo selects resources with names that contain the foo substring, like foo1 and barfoo. - description:foo selects resources with the foo token in the description, like bar and foo. - location=foo matches resources in a specified location with foo as the location name. The predicate keys type, system, location, and orgid support only the exact match (=) qualifier, not the substring qualifier (:). For example, type=foo or orgid=number. Search syntax supports the following qualifiers: - \"name:x\" - Matches x as a substring of the resource ID. - \"displayname:x\" - Match x as a substring of the resource display name. - \"column:x\" - Matches x as a substring of the column name (or nested column name) in the schema of the resource. - \"description:x\" - Matches x as a token in the resource description. - \"label:bar\" - Matches BigQuery resources that have a label (with some value) and the label key has bar as a substring. - \"label=bar\" - Matches BigQuery resources that have a label (with some value) and the label key equals bar as a string. - \"label:bar:x\" - Matches x as a substring in the value of a label with a key bar attached to a BigQuery resource. - \"label=foo:bar\" - Matches BigQuery resources where the key equals foo and the key value equals bar. - \"label.foo=bar\" - Matches BigQuery resources where the key equals foo and the key value equals bar. - \"label.foo\" - Matches BigQuery resources that have a label whose key equals foo as a string. - \"type=TYPE\" - Matches resources of a specific entry type or its type alias. - \"projectid:bar\" - Matches resources within Google Cloud projects that match bar as a substring in the ID. - \"parent:x\" - Matches x as a substring of the hierarchical path of a resource. It supports same syntax as `name` predicate. - \"orgid=number\" - Matches resources within a Google Cloud organization with the exact ID value of the number. - \"system=SYSTEM\" - Matches resources from a specified system. For example, system=bigquery matches BigQuery resources. - \"location=LOCATION\" - Matches resources in a specified location with an exact name. For example, location=us-central1 matches assets hosted in Iowa. BigQuery Omni assets support this qualifier by using the BigQuery Omni location name. For example, location=aws-us-east-1 matches BigQuery Omni assets in Northern Virginia. - \"createtime\" - Finds resources that were created within, before, or after a given date or time. For example \"createtime:2019-01-01\" matches resources created on 2019-01-01. - \"updatetime\" - Finds resources that were updated within, before, or after a given date or time. For example \"updatetime\u003e2019-01-01\" matches resources updated after 2019-01-01. ### Aspect Search To search for entries based on their attached aspects, use the following query syntax. aspect:x\tMatches x as a substring of the full path to the aspect type of an aspect that is attached to the entry, in the format projectid.location.ASPECT_TYPE_ID aspect=x\tMatches x as the full path to the aspect type of an aspect that is attached to the entry, in the format projectid.location.ASPECT_TYPE_ID aspect:xOPERATORvalue\tSearches for aspect field values. Matches x as a substring of the full path to the aspect type and field name of an aspect that is attached to the entry, in the format projectid.location.ASPECT_TYPE_ID.FIELD_NAME The list of supported {OPERATOR}s depends on the type of field in the aspect, as follows: - String: = (exact match) and : (substring) - All number types: =, :, \u003c, \u003e, \u003c=, \u003e=, =\u003e, =\u003c - Enum: = - Datetime: same as for numbers, but the values to compare are treated as datetimes instead of numbers - Boolean: = Only top-level fields of the aspect are searchable. For example, all of the following queries match entries where the value of the is-enrolled field in the employee-info aspect type is true. Other entries that match on the substring are also returned. - aspect:example-project.us-central1.employee-info.is-enrolled=true - aspect:example-project.us-central1.employee=true - aspect:employee=true Example:- You can use following filters - dataplex-types.global.bigquery-table.type={BIGLAKE_TABLE, BIGLAKE_OBJECT_TABLE, EXTERNAL_TABLE, TABLE} - dataplex-types.global.storage.type={STRUCTURED, UNSTRUCTURED} ### Logical operators A query can consist of several predicates with logical operators. If you don't specify an operator, logical AND is implied. For example, foo bar returns resources that match both predicate foo and predicate bar. Logical AND and logical OR are supported. For example, foo OR bar. You can negate a predicate with a - (hyphen) or NOT prefix. For example, -name:foo returns resources with names that don't match the predicate foo. Logical operators are case-sensitive. `OR` and `AND` are acceptable whereas `or` and `and` are not. ### Request 1. Always try to rewrite the prompt using search syntax. ### Response 1. If there are multiple search results found 1. Present the list of search results 2. Format the output in nested ordered list, for example: Given ``` { results: [ { name: \"projects/test-project/locations/us/entryGroups/@bigquery-aws-us-east-1/entries/users\" entrySource: { displayName: \"Users\" description: \"Table contains list of users.\" location: \"aws-us-east-1\" system: \"BigQuery\" } }, { name: \"projects/another_project/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/@bigquery/entries/top_customers\" entrySource: { displayName: \"Top customers\", description: \"Table contains list of best customers.\" location: \"us-central1\" system: \"BigQuery\" } }, ] } ``` Return output formatted as markdown nested list: ``` * Users: - projectId: test_project - location: aws-us-east-1 - description: Table contains list of users. * Top customers: - projectId: another_project - location: us-central1 - description: Table contains list of best customers. ``` 3. Ask to select one of the presented search results 2. If there is only one search result found 1. Present the search result immediately. 3. If there are no search result found 1. Explain that no search result was found 2. Suggest to provide a more specific search query. ## Tool: dataplex_lookup_entry ### Request 1. Always try to limit the size of the response by specifying `aspect_types` parameter. Make sure to include to select view=CUSTOM when using aspect_types parameter. If you do not know the name of the aspect type, use the `dataplex_search_aspect_types` tool. 2. If you do not know the name of the entry, use `dataplex_search_entries` tool ### Response 1.

While the Firestore interface has many of the same features as traditional databases, as a NoSQL database it differs from them in the way it describes relationships between data objects.\nIf you are new to Firestore, you can create a database and learn the basics.\nRequirements IAM Permissions Firestore uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control user and group access to Firestore resources. Toolbox will use your Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authorize and authenticate when interacting with Firestore.\nIn addition to setting the ADC for your server, you need to ensure the IAM identity has been given the correct IAM permissions for accessing Firestore.

An HTTP request is the method by which a client communicates with a server to retrieve or manipulate resources. Toolbox allows you to configure the request URL, method, headers, query parameters, and the request body for an HTTP Tool.\nURL An HTTP request URL identifies the target the client wants to access. Toolbox composes the request URL from 3 places:\nThe HTTP Source’s baseUrl. The HTTP Tool’s path field. The HTTP Tool’s pathParams for dynamic path composed during Tool invocation. For example, the following config allows you to reach different paths of the same server using multiple Tools:\nsources: my-http-source: kind: http baseUrl: https://api.example.com tools: my-post-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: POST path: /update description: Tool to update information to the example API my-get-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: Tool to search information from the example API my-dynamic-path-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /{{.myPathParam}}/search description: Tool to reach endpoint based on the input to `myPathParam` pathParams: - name: myPathParam type: string description: The dynamic path parameter Headers An HTTP request header is a key-value pair sent by a client to a server, providing additional information about the request, such as the client’s preferences, the request body content type, and other metadata. Headers specified by the HTTP Tool are combined with its HTTP Source headers for the resulting HTTP request, and override the Source headers in case of conflict. The HTTP Tool allows you to specify headers in two different ways:\nStatic headers can be specified using the headers field, and will be the same for every invocation: my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: Tool to search data from API headers: Authorization: API_KEY Content-Type: application/json Dynamic headers can be specified as parameters in the headerParams field. The name of the headerParams will be used as the header key, and the value is determined by the LLM input upon Tool invocation: my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: some description headerParams: - name: Content-Type # Example LLM input: \"application/json\" description: request content type type: string Query parameters Query parameters are key-value pairs appended to a URL after a question mark (?) to provide additional information to the server for processing the request, like filtering or sorting data.\nStatic request query parameters should be specified in the path as part of the URL itself: my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search?language=en\u0026id=1 description: Tool to search for item with ID 1 in English Dynamic request query parameters should be specified as parameters in the queryParams section: my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: Tool to search for item with ID queryParams: - name: id description: item ID type: integer Request body The request body payload is a string that supports parameter replacement following Go template’s annotations. The parameter names in the requestBody should be preceded by “.” and enclosed by double curly brackets “{{}}”. The values will be populated into the request body payload upon Tool invocation.\nExample:\nmy-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: Tool to search for person with name and age requestBody: | { \"age\": {{.age}}, \"name\": \"{{.name}}\" } bodyParams: - name: age description: age number type: integer - name: name description: name string type: string Formatting Parameters Some complex parameters (such as arrays) may require additional formatting to match the expected output. For convenience, you can specify one of the following pre-defined functions before the parameter name to format it:\nJSON The json keyword converts a parameter into a JSON format.\nNote\nUsing JSON may add quotes to the variable name for certain types (such as strings).\nExample:\nrequestBody: | { \"age\": {{json .age}}, \"name\": {{json .name}}, \"nickname\": \"{{json .nickname}}\", \"nameArray\": {{json .nameArray}} } will send the following output:\n{ \"age\": 18, \"name\": \"Katherine\", \"nickname\": \"\"Kat\"\", # Duplicate quotes \"nameArray\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"] } Example my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: some description authRequired: - my-google-auth-service - other-auth-service queryParams: - name: country description: some description type: string requestBody: | { \"age\": {{.age}}, \"city\": \"{{.city}}\" } bodyParams: - name: age description: age number type: integer - name: city description: city string type: string headers: Authorization: API_KEY Content-Type: application/json headerParams: - name: Language description: language string type: string Reference field type required description kind string true Must be “http”. source string true Name of the source the HTTP request should be sent to. description string true Description of the tool that is passed to the LLM. path string true The path of the HTTP request.

It simplifies the management of your tools by providing you with a centralized location to store and update tools, allowing you to share tools between agents and applications and update those tools without necessarily redeploying your application.\nGetting Started Installing the server For the latest version, check the releases page and use the following instructions for your OS and CPU architecture.\nBinary Container image Homebrew Compile from source Linux (AMD64) macOS (Apple Silicon) macOS (Intel) Windows (AMD64) To install Toolbox as a binary on Linux (AMD64):\n# see releases page for other versions export VERSION=0.20.0 curl -L -o toolbox https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/linux/amd64/toolbox chmod +x toolbox To install Toolbox as a binary on macOS (Apple Silicon):\n# see releases page for other versions export VERSION=0.20.0 curl -L -o toolbox https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/darwin/arm64/toolbox chmod +x toolbox To install Toolbox as a binary on macOS (Intel):\n# see releases page for other versions export VERSION=0.20.0 curl -L -o toolbox https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/darwin/amd64/toolbox chmod +x toolbox To install Toolbox as a binary on Windows (AMD64):\n# see releases page for other versions $VERSION = \"0.20.0\" Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/windows/amd64/toolbox.exe\" -OutFile \"toolbox.exe\" You can also install Toolbox as a container:\n# see releases page for other versions export VERSION=0.20.0 docker pull us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:$VERSION To install Toolbox using Homebrew on macOS or Linux:\nbrew install mcp-toolbox To install from source, ensure you have the latest version of Go installed, and then run the following command:\ngo install github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox@v0.20.0 Running the server Configure a tools.yaml to define your tools, and then execute toolbox to start the server:\n./toolbox --tools-file \"tools.yaml\" Note\nToolbox enables dynamic reloading by default. To disable, use the --disable-reload flag.\nLaunching Toolbox UI To launch Toolbox’s interactive UI, use the --ui flag. This allows you to test tools and toolsets with features such as authorized parameters. To learn more, visit Toolbox UI.\n./toolbox --ui Homebrew Users If you installed Toolbox using Homebrew, the toolbox binary is available in your system path. You can start the server with the same command:\ntoolbox --tools-file \"tools.yaml\" You can use toolbox help for a full list of flags! To stop the server, send a terminate signal (ctrl+c on most platforms).\nFor more detailed documentation on deploying to different environments, check out the resources in the How-to section\nIntegrating your application Once your server is up and running, you can load the tools into your application.

data management tool that provides a semantic layer to facilitate querying. It can be deployed in the cloud, on GCP, or on premises.\nRequirements Looker User This source only uses API authentication. You will need to create an API user to login to Looker.\nNote\nTo use the Conversational Analytics API, you will need to have the following Google Cloud Project API enabled and IAM permissions.\nAPI Enablement in GCP Enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud Project:\ngcloud services enable geminidataanalytics.googleapis.com --project=$PROJECT_ID gcloud services enable cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com --project=$PROJECT_ID IAM Permissions in GCP In addition to setting the ADC for your server, you need to ensure the IAM identity has been given the following IAM roles (or corresponding permissions):\nroles/looker.instanceUser roles/cloudaicompanion.user roles/geminidataanalytics.dataAgentStatelessUser To initialize the application default credential run gcloud auth login --update-adc in your environment before starting MCP Toolbox.\nExample sources: my-looker-source: kind: looker base_url: http://looker.example.com client_id: ${LOOKER_CLIENT_ID} client_secret: ${LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET} project: ${LOOKER_PROJECT} location: ${LOOKER_LOCATION} verify_ssl: true timeout: 600s The Looker base url will look like “https://looker.example.com”, don’t include a trailing “/”. In some cases, especially if your Looker is deployed on-premises, you may need to add the API port number like “https://looker.example.com:19999”.\nVerify ssl should almost always be “true” (all lower case) unless you are using a self-signed ssl certificate for the Looker server. Anything other than “true” will be interpreted as false.\nThe client id and client secret are seemingly random character sequences assigned by the looker server.

Step 1: Set up your BigQuery Dataset and Table In this section, we will create a BigQuery dataset and a table, then insert some data that needs to be accessed by our agent. BigQuery operations are performed against your configured Google Cloud project.\nCreate a new BigQuery dataset (replace YOUR_DATASET_NAME with your desired dataset name, e.g., toolbox_ds, and optionally specify a location like US or EU):\nexport BQ_DATASET_NAME=\"YOUR_DATASET_NAME\" # e.g., toolbox_ds export BQ_LOCATION=\"US\" # e.g., US, EU, asia-northeast1 bq --location=$BQ_LOCATION mk $BQ_DATASET_NAME You can also do this through the Google Cloud Console.\nTip\nFor a real application, ensure that the service account or user running Toolbox has the necessary IAM permissions (e.g., BigQuery Data Editor, BigQuery User) on the dataset or project. For this local quickstart with user credentials, your own permissions will apply.\nThe hotels table needs to be defined in your new dataset for use with the bq query command. First, create a file named create_hotels_table.sql with the following content:\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_NAME.hotels` ( id INT64 NOT NULL, name STRING NOT NULL, location STRING NOT NULL, price_tier STRING NOT NULL, checkin_date DATE NOT NULL, checkout_date DATE NOT NULL, booked BOOLEAN NOT NULL ); Note: Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_DATASET_NAME in the SQL with your actual project ID and dataset name.\nThen run the command below to execute the sql query:\nbq query --project_id=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --dataset_id=$BQ_DATASET_NAME --use_legacy_sql=false \u003c create_hotels_table.sql Next, populate the hotels table with some initial data. To do this, create a file named insert_hotels_data.sql and add the following SQL INSERT statement to it.\nINSERT INTO `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_NAME.hotels` (id, name, location, price_tier, checkin_date, checkout_date, booked) VALUES (1, 'Hilton Basel', 'Basel', 'Luxury', '2024-04-20', '2024-04-22', FALSE), (2, 'Marriott Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-14', '2024-04-21', FALSE), (3, 'Hyatt Regency Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-20', FALSE), (4, 'Radisson Blu Lucerne', 'Lucerne', 'Midscale', '2024-04-05', '2024-04-24', FALSE), (5, 'Best Western Bern', 'Bern', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-01', '2024-04-23', FALSE), (6, 'InterContinental Geneva', 'Geneva', 'Luxury', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-28', FALSE), (7, 'Sheraton Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-27', FALSE), (8, 'Holiday Inn Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-09', '2024-04-24', FALSE), (9, 'Courtyard Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-03', '2024-04-13', FALSE), (10, 'Comfort Inn Bern', 'Bern', 'Midscale', '2024-04-04', '2024-04-16', FALSE); Note: Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_DATASET_NAME in the SQL with your actual project ID and dataset name.\nThen run the command below to execute the sql query:\nbq query --project_id=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --dataset_id=$BQ_DATASET_NAME --use_legacy_sql=false \u003c insert_hotels_data.sql Step 2: Install and configure Toolbox In this section, we will download Toolbox, configure our tools in a tools.yaml to use BigQuery, and then run the Toolbox server.\nDownload the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:\nTip\nSelect the correct binary corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.\nexport OS=\"linux/amd64\" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64 curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.20.0/$OS/toolbox Make the binary executable:\nchmod +x toolbox Write the following into a tools.yaml file. You must replace the YOUR_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_DATASET_NAME placeholder in the config with your actual BigQuery project and dataset name. The location field is optional; if not specified, it defaults to ‘us’. The table name hotels is used directly in the statements.\nTip\nAuthentication with BigQuery is handled via Application Default Credentials (ADC). Ensure you have run gcloud auth application-default login.\nsources: my-bigquery-source: kind: bigquery project: YOUR_PROJECT_ID location: us tools: search-hotels-by-name: kind: bigquery-sql source: my-bigquery-source description: Search for hotels based on name. parameters: - name: name type: string description: The name of the hotel. statement: SELECT * FROM `YOUR_DATASET_NAME.hotels` WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', @name, '%')); search-hotels-by-location: kind: bigquery-sql source: my-bigquery-source description: Search for hotels based on location. parameters: - name: location type: string description: The location of the hotel. statement: SELECT * FROM `YOUR_DATASET_NAME.hotels` WHERE LOWER(location) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', @location, '%')); book-hotel: kind: bigquery-sql source: my-bigquery-source description: \u003e- Book a hotel by its ID.

The Python agent examples in Step 3 (e.g., await toolbox_client.load_toolset(\"my-toolset\")) rely on a toolset named my-toolset. To make those examples work, you will need to add a toolsets section to your tools.yaml file, for example:\n# Add this to your tools.yaml if using load_toolset(\"my-toolset\") # Ensure it's at the same indentation level as 'sources:' and 'tools:' toolsets: my-toolset: - search-hotels-by-name - search-hotels-by-location - book-hotel - update-hotel - cancel-hotel Alternatively, you can modify the agent code to load tools individually (e.g., using await toolbox_client.load_tool(\"search-hotels-by-name\")).\nFor more info on tools, check out the Resources section of the docs.\nRun the Toolbox server, pointing to the tools.yaml file created earlier:\n./toolbox --tools-file \"tools.yaml\" Note\nToolbox enables dynamic reloading by default. To disable, use the `--disable-reload` flag. Step 3: Connect your agent to Toolbox In this section, we will write and run an agent that will load the Tools from Toolbox.\nTip\nIf you prefer to experiment within a Google Colab environment, you can connect to a local runtime.\nIn a new terminal, install the SDK package.\nCore Langchain LlamaIndex ADK pip install toolbox-core pip install toolbox-langchain pip install toolbox-llamaindex pip install google-adk Install other required dependencies:\nCore Langchain LlamaIndex ADK # TODO(developer): replace with correct package if needed pip install langgraph langchain-google-vertexai # pip install langchain-google-genai # pip install langchain-anthropic # TODO(developer): replace with correct package if needed pip install langgraph langchain-google-vertexai # pip install langchain-google-genai # pip install langchain-anthropic # TODO(developer): replace with correct package if needed pip install llama-index-llms-google-genai # pip install llama-index-llms-anthropic pip install toolbox-core Create a new file named hotel_agent.py and copy the following code to create an agent: Core LangChain LlamaIndex ADK import asyncio from google import genai from google.genai.types import ( Content, FunctionDeclaration, GenerateContentConfig, Part, Tool, ) from toolbox_core import ToolboxClient prompt = \"\"\" You're a helpful hotel assistant.

These are required for Semantic Search and Natural Language to SQL tools. Run the following SQL commands:\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"vector\"; CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"google_ml_integration\"; CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS alloydb_ai_nl cascade; CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS parameterized_views; Step 1: Set up your AlloyDB database In this section, we will create the necessary tables and functions in your AlloyDB instance.\nCreate tables using the following commands:\nCREATE TABLE products ( product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, description TEXT, price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL, category_id INT, embedding vector(3072) -- Vector size for model(gemini-embedding-001) ); CREATE TABLE customers ( customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE cart ( cart_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, customer_id INT UNIQUE NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ); CREATE TABLE cart_items ( cart_item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, cart_id INT NOT NULL, product_id INT NOT NULL, quantity INT NOT NULL, price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (cart_id) REFERENCES cart(cart_id), FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id) ); CREATE TABLE categories ( category_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL ); Insert sample data into the tables:\nINSERT INTO categories (category_id, name) VALUES (1, 'Flowers'), (2, 'Vases'); INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, description, price, category_id, embedding) VALUES (1, 'Rose', 'A beautiful red rose', 2.50, 1, embedding('gemini-embedding-001', 'A beautiful red rose')), (2, 'Tulip', 'A colorful tulip', 1.50, 1, embedding('gemini-embedding-001', 'A colorful tulip')), (3, 'Glass Vase', 'A transparent glass vase', 10.00, 2, embedding('gemini-embedding-001', 'A transparent glass vase')), (4, 'Ceramic Vase', 'A handmade ceramic vase', 15.00, 2, embedding('gemini-embedding-001', 'A handmade ceramic vase')); INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'), (2, 'Jane Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com'); INSERT INTO cart (cart_id, customer_id) VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2); INSERT INTO cart_items (cart_id, product_id, quantity, price) VALUES (1, 1, 2, 2.50), (1, 3, 1, 10.00), (2, 2, 5, 1.50); Step 2: Install Toolbox In this section, we will download and install the Toolbox binary.\nDownload the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:\nTip\nSelect the correct binary corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.\nexport OS=\"linux/amd64\" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64 export VERSION=\"0.20.0\" curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/$OS/toolbox Make the binary executable:\nchmod +x toolbox Step 3: Configure the tools Create a tools.yaml file and add the following content. You must replace the placeholders with your actual AlloyDB configuration.\nFirst, define the data source for your tools. This tells Toolbox how to connect to your AlloyDB instance.\nsources: alloydb-pg-source: kind: alloydb-postgres project: YOUR_PROJECT_ID region: YOUR_REGION cluster: YOUR_CLUSTER instance: YOUR_INSTANCE database: YOUR_DATABASE user: YOUR_USER password: YOUR_PASSWORD Next, define the tools the agent can use. We will categorize them into three types:\n1. Structured Queries Tools These tools execute predefined SQL statements. They are ideal for common, structured queries like managing a shopping cart. Add the following to your tools.yaml file:\ntools: access-cart-information: kind: postgres-sql source: alloydb-pg-source description: \u003e- List items in customer cart. Use this tool to list items in a customer cart. This tool requires the cart ID. parameters: - name: cart_id type: integer description: The id of the cart. statement: | SELECT p.name AS product_name, ci.quantity, ci.price AS item_price, (ci.quantity * ci.price) AS total_item_price, c.created_at AS cart_created_at, ci.product_id AS product_id FROM cart_items ci JOIN cart c ON ci.cart_id = c.cart_id JOIN products p ON ci.product_id = p.product_id WHERE c.cart_id = $1; add-to-cart: kind: postgres-sql source: alloydb-pg-source description: \u003e- Add items to customer cart using the product ID and product prices from the product list. Use this tool to add items to a customer cart. This tool requires the cart ID, product ID, quantity, and price. parameters: - name: cart_id type: integer description: The id of the cart. - name: product_id type: integer description: The id of the product. - name: quantity type: integer description: The quantity of items to add. - name: price type: float description: The price of items to add. statement: | INSERT INTO cart_items (cart_id, product_id, quantity, price) VALUES($1,$2,$3,$4); delete-from-cart: kind: postgres-sql source: alloydb-pg-source description: \u003e- Remove products from customer cart. Use this tool to remove products from a customer cart. This tool requires the cart ID and product ID. parameters: - name: cart_id type: integer description: The id of the cart. - name: product_id type: integer description: The id of the product. statement: | DELETE FROM cart_items WHERE cart_id = $1 AND product_id = $2; 2. Semantic Search Tools These tools use vector embeddings to find the most relevant results based on the meaning of a user’s query, rather than just keywords. Append the following tools to the tools section in your tools.yaml:\nsearch-product-recommendations: kind: postgres-sql source: alloydb-pg-source description: \u003e- Search for products based on user needs. Use this tool to search for products. This tool requires the user's needs. parameters: - name: query type: string description: The product characteristics statement: | SELECT product_id, name, description, ROUND(CAST(price AS numeric), 2) as price FROM products ORDER BY embedding('gemini-embedding-001', $1)::vector \u003c=\u003e embedding LIMIT 5; 3. Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) Tools Create a natural language configuration for your AlloyDB cluster.\nTip\nBefore using NL2SQL tools, you must first install the alloydb_ai_nl extension and create the semantic layer under a configuration named flower_shop.\nConfigure your NL2SQL tool to use your configuration. These tools translate natural language questions into SQL queries, allowing users to interact with the database conversationally. Append the following tool to the tools section:\nask-questions-about-products: kind: alloydb-ai-nl source: alloydb-pg-source nlConfig: flower_shop description: \u003e- Ask questions related to products or brands. Use this tool to ask questions about products or brands. Always SELECT the IDs of objects when generating queries. Finally, group the tools into a toolset to make them available to the model. Add the following to the end of your tools.yaml file:\ntoolsets: flower_shop: - access-cart-information - search-product-recommendations - ask-questions-about-products - add-to-cart - delete-from-cart For more info on tools, check out the Tools section.\nStep 4: Run the Toolbox server Run the Toolbox server, pointing to the tools.yaml file created earlier:\n./toolbox --tools-file \"tools.yaml\" Step 5: Connect to MCP Inspector Run the MCP Inspector:\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector Type y when it asks to install the inspector package.\nIt should show the following when the MCP Inspector is up and running (please take note of \u003cYOUR_SESSION_TOKEN\u003e):\nStarting MCP inspector... ⚙️ Proxy server listening on localhost:6277 🔑 Session token: \u003cYOUR_SESSION_TOKEN\u003e Use this token to authenticate requests or set DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true to disable auth 🚀 MCP Inspector is up and running at: http://localhost:6274/?MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=\u003cYOUR_SESSION_TOKEN\u003e Open the above link in your browser.\nFor Transport Type, select Streamable HTTP.\nFor URL, type in http://127.0.0.1:5000/mcp.\nFor Configuration -\u003e Proxy Session Token, make sure \u003cYOUR_SESSION_TOKEN\u003e is present.\nClick Connect.\nSelect List Tools, you will see a list of tools configured in tools.yaml.\nTest out your tools here!\nWhat’s next Learn more about MCP Inspector.

If the parameter is required, Toolbox will throw an error.\nWhen the box is checked, parameter will be sent exactly as entered in the response field (e.g. empty string).\nEditing Headers To edit headers, press the “Edit Headers” button to display the header modal. Within this modal, users can make direct edits by typing into the header’s text area.\nToolbox UI validates that the headers are in correct JSON format. Other header-related errors (e.g., incorrect header names or values required by the tool) will be reported in the Response section after running the tool.\nGoogle OAuth Currently, Toolbox supports Google OAuth 2.0 as an AuthService, which allows tools to utilize authorized parameters. When a tool uses an authorized parameter, the parameter will be displayed but not editable, as it will be populated from the authentication token.\nTo provide the token, add your Google OAuth ID Token to the request header using the “Edit Headers” button and modal described above. The key should be the name of your AuthService as defined in your tool configuration file, suffixed with _token. The value should be your ID token as a string.\nSelect a tool that requires authenticated parameters The auth parameter’s text field is greyed out. This is because it cannot be entered manually and will be parsed from the resolved auth token To update request headers with the token, select “Edit Headers” (Optional) If you wish to manually edit the header, checkout the dropdown “How to extract Google OAuth ID Token manually” for guidance on retrieving ID token To edit the header automatically, click the “Auto Setup” button that is associated with your Auth Profile Enter the Client ID defined in your tools configuration file Click “Continue” Click “Sign in With Google” and login with your associated google account.

MCP Toolbox for Databases is open-source and can be run or deployed to a multitude of environments. For convenience, we release compiled binaries and docker images (but you can always compile yourself as well!).\nFor detailed instructions, check out these resources:\nQuickstart: How to Run Locally Deploy to Cloud Run Do I need a Google Cloud account/project to get started with Toolbox? Nope! While some of the sources Toolbox connects to may require GCP credentials, Toolbox doesn’t require them and can connect to a bunch of different resources that don’t.\nDoes Toolbox take contributions from external users? Absolutely! Please check out our DEVELOPER.md for instructions on how to get started developing on Toolbox instead of with it, and the CONTRIBUTING.md for instructions on completing the CLA and getting a PR accepted.\nCan Toolbox support a feature to let me do $FOO? Maybe? The best place to start is by opening an issue for discussion (or seeing if there is already one open), so we can better understand your use case and the best way to solve it. Generally we aim to prioritize the most popular issues, so make sure to +1 ones you are the most interested in.\nCan Toolbox be used for non-database tools? Currently, Toolbox is primarily focused on making it easier to create and develop tools focused on interacting with Databases. We believe that there are a lot of unique problems when interacting with Databases for Gen AI use cases, and want to prioritize solving those first.\nHowever, we’ve also received feedback that supporting more generic HTTP or GRPC tools might be helpful in assisting with migrating to Toolbox or in accomplishing more complicated workflows. We’re looking into what that might best look like in Toolbox.\nCan I use $BAR orchestration framework to use tools from Toolbox? Currently, Toolbox only supports a limited number of client SDKs at our initial launch. We are investigating support for more frameworks as well as more general approaches for users without a framework – look forward to seeing an update soon.\nWhy does Toolbox use a server-client architecture pattern? Toolbox’s server-client architecture allows us to more easily support a wide variety of languages and frameworks with a centralized implementation. It also allows us to tackle problems like connection pooling, auth, or caching more completely than entirely client-side solutions.\nWhy was Toolbox written in Go? While a large part of the Gen AI Ecosystem is predominately Python, we opted to use Go. We chose Go because it’s still easy and simple to use, but also easier to write fast, efficient, and concurrent servers. Additionally, given the server-client architecture, we can still meet many developers where they are with clients in their preferred language. As Gen AI matures, we want developers to be able to use Toolbox on the serving path of mission critical applications. It’s easier to build the needed robustness, performance and scalability in Go than in Python.\nIs Toolbox compatible with Model Context Protocol (MCP)? Yes! Toolbox is compatible with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP).

MCP Toolbox can then use this token to authentincate with Looker. This means that there is no need to get a Looker Client ID and Client Secret. This also means that MCP Toolbox can be set up as a shared resource.\nThis configuration requires Toolbox v0.14.0 or later.\nStep 1: Register the OAuth App in Looker You first need to register the OAuth application. Refer to the documentation here. You may need to ask an administrator to do this for you.\nGo to the API Explorer application, locate “Register OAuth App”, and press the “Run It” button.\nSet the client_guid to “gemini-cli”.\nSet the redirect_uri to “http://localhost:7777/oauth/callback”.\nThe display_name and description can be “Gemini-CLI” or anything meaningful.\nSet enabled to “true”.\nCheck the box confirming that you understand this API will change data.\nClick the “Run” button.\nStep 2: Install and configure Toolbox In this section, we will download Toolbox and run the Toolbox server.\nDownload the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:\nTip\nSelect the correct binary corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.\nexport OS=\"linux/amd64\" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64 curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.20.0/$OS/toolbox Make the binary executable:\nchmod +x toolbox Create a file looker_env with the settings for your Looker instance.\nexport LOOKER_BASE_URL=https://looker.example.com export LOOKER_VERIFY_SSL=true export LOOKER_USE_CLIENT_OAUTH=true In some instances you may need to append :19999 to the LOOKER_BASE_URL.\nLoad the looker_env file into your environment.\nsource looker_env Run the Toolbox server using the prebuilt Looker tools.\n./toolbox --prebuilt looker The toolbox server will begin listening on localhost port 5000. Leave it running and continue in another terminal.\nLater, when it is time to shut everything down, you can quit the toolbox server with Ctrl-C in this terminal window.\nStep 3: Configure Gemini-CLI Edit the file ~/.gemini/settings.json. Add the following, substituting your Looker server host name for looker.example.com.\n\"mcpServers\": { \"looker\": { \"httpUrl\": \"http://localhost:5000/mcp\", \"oauth\": { \"enabled\": true, \"clientId\": \"gemini-cli\", \"authorizationUrl\": \"https://looker.example.com/auth\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://looker.example.com/api/token\", \"scopes\": [\"cors_api\"] } } } The authorizationUrl should point to the URL you use to access Looker via the web UI. The tokenUrl should point to the URL you use to access Looker via the API. In some cases you will need to use the port number :19999 after the host name but before the /api/token part.\nStart Gemini-CLI.\nAuthenticate with the command /mcp auth looker. Gemini-CLI will open up a browser where you will confirm that you want to access Looker with your account.\nUse Gemini-CLI with your tools.\nUsing Toolbox as a Shared Service Toolbox can be run on another server as a shared service accessed by multiple users. We strongly recommend running toolbox behind a web proxy such as nginx which will provide SSL encryption. Google Cloud Run is another good way to run toolbox. You will connect to a service like https://toolbox.example.com/mcp. The proxy server will handle the SSL encryption and certificates. Then it will foward the requests to http://localhost:5000/mcp running in that environment. The details of the config are beyond the scope of this document, but will be familiar to your system administrators.\nTo use the shared service, just change the localhost:5000 in the httpUrl in ~/.gemini/settings.json to the host name and possibly the port of the shared service.\n","categories":"","description":"How to connect to Looker from Gemini-CLI with end-user credentials\n","excerpt":"How to connect to Looker from Gemini-CLI with end-user credentials\n","ref":"/genai-toolbox/dev/samples/looker/looker_gemini_oauth/","tags":"","title":"Gemini-CLI and OAuth"},{"body":" ","categories":"","description":"Go lang client SDK","excerpt":"Go lang client SDK","ref":"/genai-toolbox/dev/sdks/go-sdk/","tags":"","title":"Go SDK"},{"body":" ","categories":"","description":"Javascript client SDK","excerpt":"Javascript client SDK","ref":"/genai-toolbox/dev/sdks/js-sdk/","tags":"","title":"JS SDK"},{"body":"Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to data sources like Postgres.

Installed PostgreSQL 16+ and the psql client. Cloud Setup (Optional) If you plan to use Google Cloud’s Vertex AI with your agent (e.g., using vertexai=True or a Google GenAI model), follow these one-time setup steps for local development:\nInstall the Google Cloud CLI\nSet up Application Default Credentials (ADC)\nSet your project and enable Vertex AI\ngcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com Step 1: Set up your database In this section, we will create a database, insert some data that needs to be accessed by our agent, and create a database user for Toolbox to connect with.\nConnect to postgres using the psql command:\npsql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres Here, postgres denotes the default postgres superuser.\nInfo\nHaving trouble connecting? Password Prompt: If you are prompted for a password for the postgres user and do not know it (or a blank password doesn’t work), your PostgreSQL installation might require a password or a different authentication method. FATAL: role \"postgres\" does not exist: This error means the default postgres superuser role isn’t available under that name on your system. Connection refused: Ensure your PostgreSQL server is actually running. You can typically check with sudo systemctl status postgresql and start it with sudo systemctl start postgresql on Linux systems. Common Solution For password issues or if the postgres role seems inaccessible directly, try switching to the postgres operating system user first.

This page walks though different types of telemetry and observability available in Toolbox.\nToolbox exports telemetry data of logs via standard out/err, and traces/metrics through OpenTelemetry. Additional flags can be passed to Toolbox to enable different logging behavior, or to export metrics through a specific exporter.\nLogging The following flags can be used to customize Toolbox logging:\nFlag Description --log-level Preferred log level, allowed values: debug, info, warn, error. Default: info. --logging-format Preferred logging format, allowed values: standard, json. Default: standard. Example:\n./toolbox --tools-file \"tools.yaml\" --log-level warn --logging-format json Level Toolbox supports the following log levels, including:\nLog level Description Debug Debug logs typically contain information that is only useful during the debugging phase and may be of little value during production. Info Info logs include information about successful operations within the application, such as a successful start, pause, or exit of the application. Warn Warning logs are slightly less severe than error conditions. While it does not cause an error, it indicates that an operation might fail in the future if action is not taken now. Error Error log is assigned to event logs that contain an application error message. Toolbox will only output logs that are equal or more severe to the level that it is set. Below are the log levels that Toolbox supports in the order of severity.\nFormat Toolbox supports both standard and structured logging format.\nThe standard logging outputs log as string:\n2024-11-12T15:08:11.451377-08:00 INFO \"Initialized 0 sources.\\n\" The structured logging outputs log as JSON:\n{ \"timestamp\":\"2024-11-04T16:45:11.987299-08:00\", \"severity\":\"ERROR\", \"logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation\":{...}, \"message\":\"unable to parse tool file at \\\"tools.yaml\\\": \\\"cloud-sql-postgres1\\\" is not a valid kind of data source\" } Tip\nlogging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation shows the source code location information associated with the log entry, if any.\nTelemetry Toolbox is supports exporting metrics and traces to any OpenTelemetry compatible exporter.\nMetrics A metric is a measurement of a service captured at runtime. The collected data can be used to provide important insights into the service. Toolbox provides the following custom metrics:\nMetric Name Description toolbox.server.toolset.get.count Counts the number of toolset manifest requests served toolbox.server.tool.get.count Counts the number of tool manifest requests served toolbox.server.tool.get.invoke Counts the number of tool invocation requests served toolbox.server.mcp.sse.count Counts the number of mcp sse connection requests served toolbox.server.mcp.post.count Counts the number of mcp post requests served All custom metrics have the following attributes/labels:\nMetric Attributes Description toolbox.name Name of the toolset or tool, if applicable. toolbox.operation.status Operation status code, for example: success, failure. toolbox.sse.sessionId Session id for sse connection, if applicable. toolbox.method Method of JSON-RPC request, if applicable. Traces A trace is a tree of spans that shows the path that a request makes through an application.\nSpans generated by Toolbox server is prefixed with toolbox/server/. For example, when user run Toolbox, it will generate spans for the following, with toolbox/server/init as the root span:\nResource Attributes All metrics and traces generated within Toolbox will be associated with a unified resource. The list of resource attributes included are:\nResource Name Description TelemetrySDK TelemetrySDK version info. OS OS attributes including OS description and OS type. Container Container attributes including container ID, if applicable. Host Host attributes including host name. SchemaURL Sets the schema URL for the configured resource. service.name Open telemetry service name. Defaulted to toolbox. User can set the service name via flag mentioned above to distinguish between different toolbox service. service.version The version of Toolbox used. Exporter An exporter is responsible for processing and exporting telemetry data. Toolbox generates telemetry data within the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), and user can choose to use exporters that are designed to support the OpenTelemetry Protocol. Within Toolbox, we provide two types of exporter implementation to choose from, either the Google Cloud Exporter that will send data directly to the backend, or the OTLP Exporter along with a Collector that will act as a proxy to collect and export data to the telemetry backend of user’s choice.\nGoogle Cloud Exporter The Google Cloud Exporter directly exports telemetry to Google Cloud Monitoring. It utilizes the GCP Metric Exporter and GCP Trace Exporter.\nNote\nIf you’re using Google Cloud Monitoring, the following APIs will need to be enabled:\nCloud Logging API Cloud Monitoring API Cloud Trace API OTLP Exporter This implementation uses the default OTLP Exporter over HTTP for metrics and traces. You can use this exporter if you choose to export your telemetry data to a Collector.\nCollector A collector acts as a proxy between the application and the telemetry backend. It receives telemetry data, transforms it, and then exports data to backends that can store it permanently. Toolbox provide an option to export telemetry data to user’s choice of backend(s) that are compatible with the Open Telemetry Protocol (OTLP). If you would like to use a collector, please refer to this Export Telemetry using the Otel Collector.\nFlags The following flags are used to determine Toolbox’s telemetry configuration:\nflag type description --telemetry-gcp bool Enable exporting directly to Google Cloud Monitoring. Default is false. --telemetry-otlp string Enable exporting using OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) to the specified endpoint (e.g. “http://127.0.0.1:4318”). --telemetry-service-name string Sets the value of the service.name resource attribute. Default is toolbox. In addition to the flags noted above, you can also make additional configuration for OpenTelemetry via the General SDK Configuration through environmental variables.\nExamples:\nTo enable Google Cloud Exporter:\n./toolbox --telemetry-gcp To enable OTLP Exporter, provide Collector endpoint:\n./toolbox --telemetry-otlp=\"http://127.0.0.1:4553\" ","categories":"","description":"An overview of telemetry and observability in Toolbox.\n","excerpt":"An overview of telemetry and observability in Toolbox.\n","ref":"/genai-toolbox/dev/concepts/telemetry/","tags":"","title":"Telemetry"},{"body":"A tool represents an action your agent can take, such as running a SQL statement. You can define Tools as a map in the tools section of your tools.yaml file. Typically, a tool will require a source to act on:\ntools: search_flights_by_number: kind: postgres-sql source: my-pg-instance statement: | SELECT * FROM flights WHERE airline = $1 AND flight_number = $2 LIMIT 10 description: | Use this tool to get information for a specific flight. Takes an airline code and flight number and returns info on the flight. Do NOT use this tool with a flight id. Do NOT guess an airline code or flight number. An airline code is a code for an airline service consisting of a two-character airline designator and followed by a flight number, which is a 1 to 4 digit number. For example, if given CY 0123, the airline is \"CY\", and flight_number is \"123\". Another example for this is DL 1234, the airline is \"DL\", and flight_number is \"1234\". If the tool returns more than one option choose the date closest to today. Example: {{ \"airline\": \"CY\", \"flight_number\": \"888\", }} Example: {{ \"airline\": \"DL\", \"flight_number\": \"1234\", }} parameters: - name: airline type: string description: Airline unique 2 letter identifier - name: flight_number type: string description: 1 to 4 digit number Specifying Parameters Parameters for each Tool will define what inputs the agent will need to provide to invoke them. Parameters should be pass as a list of Parameter objects:\nparameters: - name: airline type: string description: Airline unique 2 letter identifier - name: flight_number type: string description: 1 to 4 digit number Basic Parameters Basic parameters types include string, integer, float, boolean types. In most cases, the description will be provided to the LLM as context on specifying the parameter.\nparameters: - name: airline type: string description: Airline unique 2 letter identifier field type required description name string true Name of the parameter. type string true Must be one of “string”, “integer”, “float”, “boolean” “array” description string true Natural language description of the parameter to describe it to the agent. default parameter type false Default value of the parameter. If provided, required will be false. required bool false Indicate if the parameter is required. Default to true. allowedValues []string false Input value will be checked against this field. Regex is also supported. excludedValues []string false Input value will be checked against this field. Regex is also supported. escape string false Only available for type string. Indicate the escaping delimiters used for the parameter. This field is intended to be used with templateParameters. Must be one of “single-quotes”, “double-quotes”, “backticks”, “square-brackets”. minValue int or float false Only available for type integer and float. Indicate the minimum value allowed. maxValue int or float false Only available for type integer and float. Indicate the maximum value allowed. Array Parameters The array type is a list of items passed in as a single parameter. To use the array type, you must also specify what kind of items are in the list using the items field:\nparameters: - name: preferred_airlines type: array description: A list of airline, ordered by preference. items: name: name type: string description: Name of the airline. statement: | SELECT * FROM airlines WHERE preferred_airlines = ANY($1); field type required description name string true Name of the parameter. type string true Must be “array” description string true Natural language description of the parameter to describe it to the agent. default parameter type false Default value of the parameter. If provided, required will be false. required bool false Indicate if the parameter is required. Default to true. allowedValues []string false Input value will be checked against this field. Regex is also supported. excludedValues []string false Input value will be checked against this field. Regex is also supported. items parameter object true Specify a Parameter object for the type of the values in the array. Note\nItems in array should not have a default or required value. If provided, it will be ignored.\nMap Parameters The map type is a collection of key-value pairs. It can be configured in two ways:\nGeneric Map: By default, it accepts values of any primitive type (string, integer, float, boolean), allowing for mixed data. Typed Map: By setting the valueType field, you can enforce that all values within the map must be of the same specified type. Generic Map (Mixed Value Types) This is the default behavior when valueType is omitted. It’s useful for passing a flexible group of settings.\nparameters: - name: execution_context type: map description: A flexible set of key-value pairs for the execution environment. Typed Map Specify valueType to ensure all values in the map are of the same type. An error will be thrown in case of value type mismatch.\nparameters: - name: user_scores type: map description: A map of user IDs to their scores. All scores must be integers. valueType: integer # This enforces the value type for all entries. Authenticated Parameters Authenticated parameters are automatically populated with user information decoded from ID tokens that are passed in request headers. They do not take input values in request bodies like other parameters. To use authenticated parameters, you must configure the tool to map the required authServices to specific claims within the user’s ID token.\ntools: search_flights_by_user_id: kind: postgres-sql source: my-pg-instance statement: | SELECT * FROM flights WHERE user_id = $1 parameters: - name: user_id type: string description: Auto-populated from Google login authServices: # Refer to one of the `authServices` defined - name: my-google-auth # `sub` is the OIDC claim field for user ID field: sub field type required description name string true Name of the authServices used to verify the OIDC auth token. field string true Claim field decoded from the OIDC token used to auto-populate this parameter. Template Parameters Template parameters types include string, integer, float, boolean types. In most cases, the description will be provided to the LLM as context on specifying the parameter. Template parameters will be inserted into the SQL statement before executing the prepared statement. They will be inserted without quotes, so to insert a string using template parameters, quotes must be explicitly added within the string.\nTemplate parameter arrays can also be used similarly to basic parameters, and array items must be strings. Once inserted into the SQL statement, the outer layer of quotes will be removed. Therefore to insert strings into the SQL statement, a set of quotes must be explicitly added within the string.\nWarning\nBecause template parameters can directly replace identifiers, column names, and table names, they are prone to SQL injections. Basic parameters are preferred for performance and safety reasons.\nTip\nTo minimize SQL injection risk when using template parameters, always provide the allowedValues field within the parameter to restrict inputs. Alternatively, for string type parameters, you can use the escape field to add delimiters to the identifier. For integer or float type parameters, you can use minValue and maxValue to define the allowable range.\ntools: select_columns_from_table: kind: postgres-sql source: my-pg-instance statement: | SELECT {{array .columnNames}} FROM {{.tableName}} description: | Use this tool to list all information from a specific table. Example: {{ \"tableName\": \"flights\", \"columnNames\": [\"id\", \"name\"] }} templateParameters: - name: tableName type: string description: Table to select from - name: columnNames type: array description: The columns to select items: name: column type: string description: Name of a column to select escape: double-quotes # with this, the statement will resolve to `SELECT \"id\", \"name\" FROM flights` field type required description name string true Name of the template parameter. type string true Must be one of “string”, “integer”, “float”, “boolean”, “array” description string true Natural language description of the template parameter to describe it to the agent. default parameter type false Default value of the parameter. If provided, required will be false. required bool false Indicate if the parameter is required. Default to true. allowedValues []string false Input value will be checked against this field. Regex is also supported. excludedValues []string false Input value will be checked against this field. Regex is also supported. items parameter object true (if array) Specify a Parameter object for the type of the values in the array (string only). Authorized Invocations You can require an authorization check for any Tool invocation request by specifying an authRequired field. Specify a list of authServices defined in the previous section.\ntools: search_all_flight: kind: postgres-sql source: my-pg-instance statement: | SELECT * FROM flights # A list of `authServices` defined previously authRequired: - my-google-auth - other-auth-service Kinds of tools ","categories":"","description":"Tools define actions an agent can take -- such as reading and writing to a source.\n","excerpt":"Tools define actions an agent can take -- such as reading and writing …","ref":"/genai-toolbox/dev/resources/tools/","tags":"","title":"Tools"},{"body":"About A clickhouse-list-databases tool lists all available databases in a ClickHouse instance.

For details, see the configuration section.\nDeploy to Cloud Run Upload tools.yaml as a secret:\ngcloud secrets create tools --data-file=tools.yaml If you already have a secret and want to update the secret version, execute the following:\ngcloud secrets versions add tools --data-file=tools.yaml Set an environment variable to the container image that you want to use for cloud run:\nexport IMAGE=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:latest Note\nThe $PORT Environment Variable\nGoogle Cloud Run dictates the port your application must listen on by setting the $PORT environment variable inside your container. This value defaults to 8080. Your application’s --port argument must be set to listen on this port. If there is a mismatch, the container will fail to start and the deployment will time out.\nDeploy Toolbox to Cloud Run using the following command:\ngcloud run deploy toolbox \\ --image $IMAGE \\ --service-account toolbox-identity \\ --region us-central1 \\ --set-secrets \"/app/tools.yaml=tools:latest\" \\ --args=\"--tools-file=/app/tools.yaml\",\"--address=0.0.0.0\",\"--port=8080\" # --allow-unauthenticated # https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/public#gcloud If you are using a VPC network, use the command below:\ngcloud run deploy toolbox \\ --image $IMAGE \\ --service-account toolbox-identity \\ --region us-central1 \\ --set-secrets \"/app/tools.yaml=tools:latest\" \\ --args=\"--tools-file=/app/tools.yaml\",\"--address=0.0.0.0\",\"--port=8080\" \\ # TODO(dev): update the following to match your VPC if necessary --network default \\ --subnet default # --allow-unauthenticated # https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/public#gcloud Connecting with Toolbox Client SDK You can connect to Toolbox Cloud Run instances directly through the SDK.\nSet up Cloud Run Invoker role access to your Cloud Run service.\n(Only for local runs) Set up Application Default Credentials for the principal you set up the Cloud Run Invoker role access to.\nRun the following to retrieve a non-deterministic URL for the cloud run service:\ngcloud run services describe toolbox --format 'value(status.url)' Import and initialize the toolbox client with the URL retrieved above:\nPython Javascript Go from toolbox_core import ToolboxClient, auth_methods # Replace with the Cloud Run service URL generated in the previous step URL = \"https://cloud-run-url.app\" auth_token_provider = auth_methods.aget_google_id_token(URL) # can also use sync method async with ToolboxClient( URL, client_headers={\"Authorization\": auth_token_provider}, ) as toolbox: import { ToolboxClient } from '@toolbox-sdk/core'; import {getGoogleIdToken} from '@toolbox-sdk/core/auth' // Replace with the Cloud Run service URL generated in the previous step. const URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'; const authTokenProvider = () =\u003e getGoogleIdToken(URL); const client = new ToolboxClient(URL, null, {\"Authorization\": authTokenProvider}); import \"github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox-sdk-go/core\" func main() { // Replace with the Cloud Run service URL generated in the previous step.

They often contain the specific error message needed to diagnose the problem.\nDeployment Fails with “Container failed to start”: This is almost always caused by a port mismatch. Ensure your container’s --port argument is set to 8080 to match the $PORT environment variable provided by Cloud Run.\nClient Receives Permission Denied Error (401 or 403): If your client application (e.g., your local SDK) gets a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden error when trying to call your Cloud Run service, it means the client is not properly authenticated as an invoker.\nEnsure the user or service account calling the service has the Cloud Run Invoker (roles/run.invoker) IAM role. If running locally, make sure your Application Default Credentials are set up correctly by running gcloud auth application-default login. Service Fails to Access Secrets (in logs): If your application starts but the logs show errors like “permission denied” when trying to access Secret Manager, it means the Toolbox service account is missing permissions.\nEnsure the toolbox-identity service account has the Secret Manager Secret Accessor (roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor) IAM role.

Installed PostgreSQL 16+ and the psql client. Cloud Setup (Optional) If you plan to use Google Cloud’s Vertex AI with your agent (e.g., using vertexai=True or a Google GenAI model), follow these one-time setup steps for local development:\nInstall the Google Cloud CLI\nSet up Application Default Credentials (ADC)\nSet your project and enable Vertex AI\ngcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com Step 1: Set up your database In this section, we will create a database, insert some data that needs to be accessed by our agent, and create a database user for Toolbox to connect with.\nConnect to postgres using the psql command:\npsql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres Here, postgres denotes the default postgres superuser.\nInfo\nHaving trouble connecting? Password Prompt: If you are prompted for a password for the postgres user and do not know it (or a blank password doesn’t work), your PostgreSQL installation might require a password or a different authentication method. FATAL: role \"postgres\" does not exist: This error means the default postgres superuser role isn’t available under that name on your system. Connection refused: Ensure your PostgreSQL server is actually running. You can typically check with sudo systemctl status postgresql and start it with sudo systemctl start postgresql on Linux systems. Common Solution For password issues or if the postgres role seems inaccessible directly, try switching to the postgres operating system user first. This user often has permission to connect without a password for local connections (this is called peer authentication).\nsudo -i -u postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 Once you are in the psql shell using this method, you can proceed with the database creation steps below. Afterwards, type \\q to exit psql, and then exit to return to your normal user shell.\nIf desired, once connected to psql as the postgres OS user, you can set a password for the postgres database user using: ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'your_chosen_password';. This would allow direct connection with -U postgres and a password next time.\nCreate a new database and a new user:\nTip\nFor a real application, it’s best to follow the principle of least permission and only grant the privileges your application needs.\nCREATE USER toolbox_user WITH PASSWORD 'my-password'; CREATE DATABASE toolbox_db; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE toolbox_db TO toolbox_user; ALTER DATABASE toolbox_db OWNER TO toolbox_user; End the database session:\n\\q (If you used sudo -i -u postgres and then psql, remember you might also need to type exit after \\q to leave the postgres user’s shell session.)\nConnect to your database with your new user:\npsql -h 127.0.0.1 -U toolbox_user -d toolbox_db Create a table using the following command:\nCREATE TABLE hotels( id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR NOT NULL, location VARCHAR NOT NULL, price_tier VARCHAR NOT NULL, checkin_date DATE NOT NULL, checkout_date DATE NOT NULL, booked BIT NOT NULL ); Insert data into the table.\nINSERT INTO hotels(id, name, location, price_tier, checkin_date, checkout_date, booked) VALUES (1, 'Hilton Basel', 'Basel', 'Luxury', '2024-04-22', '2024-04-20', B'0'), (2, 'Marriott Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-14', '2024-04-21', B'0'), (3, 'Hyatt Regency Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-20', B'0'), (4, 'Radisson Blu Lucerne', 'Lucerne', 'Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-05', B'0'), (5, 'Best Western Bern', 'Bern', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-01', B'0'), (6, 'InterContinental Geneva', 'Geneva', 'Luxury', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-28', B'0'), (7, 'Sheraton Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-27', '2024-04-02', B'0'), (8, 'Holiday Inn Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-09', B'0'), (9, 'Courtyard Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-03', '2024-04-13', B'0'), (10, 'Comfort Inn Bern', 'Bern', 'Midscale', '2024-04-04', '2024-04-16', B'0'); End the database session:\n\\q Step 2: Install and configure Toolbox In this section, we will download Toolbox, configure our tools in a tools.yaml, and then run the Toolbox server.\nDownload the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:\nTip\nSelect the correct binary corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.\nexport OS=\"linux/amd64\" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64 curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.20.0/$OS/toolbox Make the binary executable:\nchmod +x toolbox Write the following into a tools.yaml file.

Password Prompt: If you are prompted for a password for the postgres user and do not know it (or a blank password doesn’t work), your PostgreSQL installation might require a password or a different authentication method. FATAL: role \"postgres\" does not exist: This error means the default postgres superuser role isn’t available under that name on your system. Connection refused: Ensure your PostgreSQL server is actually running. You can typically check with sudo systemctl status postgresql and start it with sudo systemctl start postgresql on Linux systems. Common Solution For password issues or if the postgres role seems inaccessible directly, try switching to the postgres operating system user first. This user often has permission to connect without a password for local connections (this is called peer authentication).\nsudo -i -u postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 Once you are in the psql shell using this method, you can proceed with the database creation steps below. Afterwards, type \\q to exit psql, and then exit to return to your normal user shell.\nIf desired, once connected to psql as the postgres OS user, you can set a password for the postgres database user using: ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'your_chosen_password';. This would allow direct connection with -U postgres and a password next time.\nCreate a new database and a new user:\nTip\nFor a real application, it’s best to follow the principle of least permission and only grant the privileges your application needs.\nCREATE USER toolbox_user WITH PASSWORD 'my-password'; CREATE DATABASE toolbox_db; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE toolbox_db TO toolbox_user; ALTER DATABASE toolbox_db OWNER TO toolbox_user; End the database session:\n\\q (If you used sudo -i -u postgres and then psql, remember you might also need to type exit after \\q to leave the postgres user’s shell session.)\nConnect to your database with your new user:\npsql -h 127.0.0.1 -U toolbox_user -d toolbox_db Create a table using the following command:\nCREATE TABLE hotels( id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR NOT NULL, location VARCHAR NOT NULL, price_tier VARCHAR NOT NULL, checkin_date DATE NOT NULL, checkout_date DATE NOT NULL, booked BIT NOT NULL ); Insert data into the table.\nINSERT INTO hotels(id, name, location, price_tier, checkin_date, checkout_date, booked) VALUES (1, 'Hilton Basel', 'Basel', 'Luxury', '2024-04-22', '2024-04-20', B'0'), (2, 'Marriott Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-14', '2024-04-21', B'0'), (3, 'Hyatt Regency Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-20', B'0'), (4, 'Radisson Blu Lucerne', 'Lucerne', 'Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-05', B'0'), (5, 'Best Western Bern', 'Bern', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-01', B'0'), (6, 'InterContinental Geneva', 'Geneva', 'Luxury', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-28', B'0'), (7, 'Sheraton Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-27', '2024-04-02', B'0'), (8, 'Holiday Inn Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-09', B'0'), (9, 'Courtyard Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-03', '2024-04-13', B'0'), (10, 'Comfort Inn Bern', 'Bern', 'Midscale', '2024-04-04', '2024-04-16', B'0'); End the database session:\n\\q Step 2: Install and configure Toolbox In this section, we will download Toolbox, configure our tools in a tools.yaml, and then run the Toolbox server.\nDownload the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:\nTip\nSelect the correct binary corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.\nexport OS=\"linux/amd64\" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64 curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.20.0/$OS/toolbox Make the binary executable:\nchmod +x toolbox Write the following into a tools.yaml file.

It removes the need to run, operate, and maintain multiple agents/collectors.\nConfigure the Collector To configure the collector, you will have to provide a configuration file. The configuration file consists of four classes of pipeline component that access telemetry data.\nReceivers Processors Exporters Connectors Example of setting up the classes of pipeline components (in this example, we don’t use connectors):\nreceivers: otlp: protocols: http: endpoint: \"127.0.0.1:4553\" exporters: googlecloud: project: \u003cYOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT\u003e processors: batch: send_batch_size: 200 After each pipeline component is configured, you will enable it within the service section of the configuration file.\nservice: pipelines: traces: receivers: [\"otlp\"] processors: [\"batch\"] exporters: [\"googlecloud\"] Running the Collector There are a couple of steps to run and use a Collector.\nInstall the Collector binary. Pull a binary or Docker image for the OpenTelemetry contrib collector.\nSet up credentials for telemetry backend.\nSet up the Collector config. Below are some examples for setting up the Collector config:\nGoogle Cloud Exporter Google Managed Service for Prometheus Exporter Run the Collector with the configuration file.\n./otelcol-contrib --config=collector-config.yaml Run toolbox with the --telemetry-otlp flag. Configure it to send them to http://127.0.0.1:4553 (for HTTP) or the Collector’s URL.\n./toolbox --telemetry-otlp=http://127.0.0.1:4553 Once telemetry datas are collected, you can view them in your telemetry backend. If you are using GCP exporters, telemetry will be visible in GCP dashboard at Metrics Explorer and Trace Explorer.\nNote\nIf you are exporting to Google Cloud monitoring, we recommend that you use the Google Cloud Exporter for traces and the Google Managed Service for Prometheus Exporter for metrics.\n","categories":"","description":"How to set up and configure Toolbox to use the Otel Collector.\n","excerpt":"How to set up and configure Toolbox to use the Otel Collector.\n","ref":"/genai-toolbox/dev/how-to/export_telemetry/","tags":"","title":"Export Telemetry"},{"body":"Overview Model Context Protocol is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Check out this page on how to connect to Toolbox via MCP.\nStep 1: Set up your database In this section, we will create a database, insert some data that needs to be access by our agent, and create a database user for Toolbox to connect with.\nConnect to postgres using the psql command:\npsql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres Here, postgres denotes the default postgres superuser.\nCreate a new database and a new user:\nTip\nFor a real application, it’s best to follow the principle of least permission and only grant the privileges your application needs.\nCREATE USER toolbox_user WITH PASSWORD 'my-password'; CREATE DATABASE toolbox_db; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE toolbox_db TO toolbox_user; ALTER DATABASE toolbox_db OWNER TO toolbox_user; End the database session:\n\\q Connect to your database with your new user:\npsql -h 127.0.0.1 -U toolbox_user -d toolbox_db Create a table using the following command:\nCREATE TABLE hotels( id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR NOT NULL, location VARCHAR NOT NULL, price_tier VARCHAR NOT NULL, checkin_date DATE NOT NULL, checkout_date DATE NOT NULL, booked BIT NOT NULL ); Insert data into the table.\nINSERT INTO hotels(id, name, location, price_tier, checkin_date, checkout_date, booked) VALUES (1, 'Hilton Basel', 'Basel', 'Luxury', '2024-04-22', '2024-04-20', B'0'), (2, 'Marriott Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-14', '2024-04-21', B'0'), (3, 'Hyatt Regency Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-20', B'0'), (4, 'Radisson Blu Lucerne', 'Lucerne', 'Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-05', B'0'), (5, 'Best Western Bern', 'Bern', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-01', B'0'), (6, 'InterContinental Geneva', 'Geneva', 'Luxury', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-28', B'0'), (7, 'Sheraton Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-27', '2024-04-02', B'0'), (8, 'Holiday Inn Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-09', B'0'), (9, 'Courtyard Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-03', '2024-04-13', B'0'), (10, 'Comfort Inn Bern', 'Bern', 'Midscale', '2024-04-04', '2024-04-16', B'0'); End the database session:\n\\q Step 2: Install and configure Toolbox In this section, we will download Toolbox, configure our tools in a tools.yaml, and then run the Toolbox server.\nDownload the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:\nTip\nSelect the correct binary corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.\nexport OS=\"linux/amd64\" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64 curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.20.0/$OS/toolbox Make the binary executable:\nchmod +x toolbox Write the following into a tools.yaml file.
