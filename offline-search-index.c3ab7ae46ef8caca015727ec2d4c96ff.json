[{"body":"About AlloyDB for PostgreSQL is a fully-managed, PostgreSQL-compatible database for demanding transactional workloads. It provides enterprise-grade performance and availability while maintaining 100% compatibility with open-source PostgreSQL.\nIf you are new to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, you can create a free trial cluster.\nRequirements IAM Permissions By default, AlloyDB for PostgreSQL source uses the AlloyDB Go Connector to authorize and establish mTLS connections to your AlloyDB instance. The Go connector uses your Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authorize your connection to AlloyDB.\nIn addition to setting the ADC for your server, you need to ensure the IAM identity has been given the following IAM roles (or corresponding permissions):\nroles/alloydb.client roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer Networking AlloyDB supports connecting over both from external networks via the internet (public IP), and internal networks (private IP). For more information on choosing between the two options, see the AlloyDB page Connection overview.\nYou can configure the ipType parameter in your source configuration to public or private to match your cluster’s configuration. Regardless of which you choose, all connections use IAM-based authorization and are encrypted with mTLS.\nAuthentication This source supports both password-based authentication and IAM authentication (using your Application Default Credentials).\nStandard Authentication To connect using user/password, create a PostgreSQL user and input your credentials in the user and password fields.\nuser: ${USER_NAME} password: ${PASSWORD} IAM Authentication To connect using IAM authentication:\nPrepare your database instance and user following this guide. You could choose one of the two ways to log in: Specify your IAM email as the user. Leave your user field blank. Toolbox will fetch the ADC automatically and log in using the email associated with it. Leave the password field blank. Example sources: my-alloydb-pg-source: kind: alloydb-postgres project: my-project-id region: us-central1 cluster: my-cluster instance: my-instance database: my_db user: ${USER_NAME} password: ${PASSWORD} # ipType: \"public\" Tip\nUse environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME} instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.\nReference field type required description kind string true Must be “alloydb-postgres”. project string true Id of the GCP project that the cluster was created in (e.g. “my-project-id”). region string true Name of the GCP region that the cluster was created in (e.g. “us-central1”). cluster string true Name of the AlloyDB cluster (e.g. “my-cluster”). instance string true Name of the AlloyDB instance within the cluster (e.g. “my-instance”). database string true Name of the Postgres database to connect to (e.g. “my_db”). user string false Name of the Postgres user to connect as (e.g. “my-pg-user”).

Natural language streamlines the development of generative AI applications by transferring the complexity of converting natural language to SQL from the application layer to the database layer.\nRequirements Tip\nAlloyDB AI natural language is currently in gated public preview. For more information on availability and limitations, please see AlloyDB AI natural language overview\nTo enable AlloyDB AI natural language for your AlloyDB cluster, please follow the steps listed in the Generate SQL queries that answer natural language questions, including enabling the extension and configuring context for your application.\nConfiguration Specifying an nl_config A nl_config is a configuration that associates an application to schema objects, examples and other contexts that can be used. A large application can also use different configurations for different parts of the app, as long as the correct configuration can be specified when a question is sent from that part of the application.\nOnce you’ve followed the steps for configuring context, you can use the context field when configuring a alloydb-ai-nl tool. When this tool is invoked, the SQL will be generated and executed using this context.\nSpecifying Parameters to PSV’s Parameterized Secure Views (PSVs) are a feature unique to AlloyDB that allows you allow you to require one or more named parameter values passed to the view when querying it, somewhat like bind variables with ordinary database queries.\nYou can use the nlConfigParameters to list the parameters required for your nl_config. You must supply all parameters required for all PSVs in the context. It’s strongly recommended to use features like Authenticated Parameters or Bound Parameters to provide secure access to queries generated using natural language, as these parameters are not visible to the LLM.\nExample tools: ask_questions: kind: alloydb-ai-nl source: my-alloydb-source description: \"Ask questions to check information about flights\" nlConfig: \"cymbal_air_nl_config\" nlConfigParameters: - name: user_email type: string description: User ID of the logged in user. # note: we strongly recommend using features like Authenticated or # Bound parameters to prevent the LLM from seeing these params and # specifying values it shouldn't in the tool input authServices: - name: my_google_service field: email Reference field type required description kind string true Must be “alloydb-ai-nl”. source string true Name of the AlloyDB source the natural language query should execute on. description string true Description of the tool that is passed to the LLM. nlConfig string true The name of the nl_config in AlloyDB nlConfigParameters parameters true List of PSV parameters defined in the nl_config ","categories":"","description":"The \"alloydb-ai-nl\" tool leverages  [AlloyDB AI](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/ai) next-generation Natural  Language support to provide the ability to query the database directly using natural language.\n","excerpt":"The \"alloydb-ai-nl\" tool leverages  [AlloyDB …","ref":"/genai-toolbox/resources/tools/alloydb-ai-nl/","tags":"","title":"alloydb-ai-nl"},{"body":"AuthServices represent services that handle authentication and authorization.

An HTTP request is the method by which a client communicates with a server to retrieve or manipulate resources. Toolbox allows you to configure the request URL, method, headers, query parameters, and the request body for an HTTP Tool.\nURL An HTTP request URL identifies the target the client wants to access. Toolbox composes the request URL from the HTTP Source’s baseUrl and the HTTP Tool’s path. For example, the following config allows you to reach different paths of the same server using multiple Tools:\nsources: my-http-source: kind: http baseUrl: https://api.example.com tools: my-post-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: POST path: /update description: Tool to update information to the example API my-get-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: Tool to search information from the example API Headers An HTTP request header is a key-value pair sent by a client to a server, providing additional information about the request, such as the client’s preferences, the request body content type, and other metadata. Headers specified by the HTTP Tool are combined with its HTTP Source headers for the resulting HTTP request, and override the Source headers in case of conflict. The HTTP Tool allows you to specify headers in two different ways:\nStatic headers can be specified using the headers field, and will be the same for every invocation: my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: Tool to search data from API headers: Authorization: API_KEY Content-Type: application/json Dynamic headers can be specified as parameters in the headerParams field. The name of the headerParams will be used as the header key, and the value is determined by the LLM input upon Tool invocation: my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: some description headerParams: - name: Content-Type # Example LLM input: \"application/json\" description: request content type type: string Query parameters Query parameters are key-value pairs appended to a URL after a question mark (?) to provide additional information to the server for processing the request, like filtering or sorting data.\nStatic request query parameters should be specified in the path as part of the URL itself: my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search?language=en\u0026id=1 description: Tool to search for item with ID 1 in English Dynamic request query parameters should be specified as parameters in the queryParams section: my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: Tool to search for item with ID queryParams: - name: id description: item ID type: integer Request body The request body payload is a string that supports parameter replacement following Go template’s annotations. The parameter names in the requestBody should be preceded by “.” and enclosed by double curly brackets “{{}}”. The values will be populated into the request body payload upon Tool invocation.\nExample:\nmy-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: Tool to search for person with name and age requestBody: | { \"age\": {{.age}}, \"name\": \"{{.name}}\" } bodyParams: - name: age description: age number type: integer - name: name description: name string type: string Formatting Parameters Some complex parameters (such as arrays) may require additional formatting to match the expected output. For convenience, you can specify one of the following pre-defined functions before the parameter name to format it:\nJSON The json keyword converts a parameter into a JSON format.\nNote\nUsing JSON may add quotes to the variable name for certain types (such as strings).\nExample:\nrequestBody: | { \"age\": {{json .age}}, \"name\": {{json .name}}, \"nickname\": \"{{json .nickname}}\", \"nameArray\": {{json .nameArray}} } will send the following output:\n{ \"age\": 18, \"name\": \"Katherine\", \"nickname\": \"\"Kat\"\", # Duplicate quotes \"nameArray\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"] } Example my-http-tool: kind: http source: my-http-source method: GET path: /search description: some description authRequired: - my-google-auth-service - other-auth-service queryParams: - name: country description: some description type: string requestBody: | { \"age\": {{.age}}, \"city\": \"{{.city}}\" } bodyParams: - name: age description: age number type: integer - name: city description: city string type: string headers: Authorization: API_KEY Content-Type: application/json headerParams: - name: Language description: language string type: string Reference field type required description kind string true Must be “http”. source string true Name of the source the HTTP request should be sent to. description string true Description of the tool that is passed to the LLM. path string true The path of the HTTP request. You can include static query parameters in the path string. method string true The HTTP method to use (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). headers map[string]string false A map of headers to include in the HTTP request (overrides source headers). requestBody string false The request body payload. Use go template with the parameter name as the placeholder (e.g., {{.id}} will be replaced with the value of the parameter that has name id in the bodyParams section). queryParams parameters false List of parameters that will be inserted into the query string. bodyParams parameters false List of parameters that will be inserted into the request body payload. headerParams parameters false List of parameters that will be inserted as the request headers.

It enables you to develop tools easier, faster, and more securely by handling the complexities such as connection pooling, authentication, and more.\nNote\nThis product was originally named “Gen AI Toolbox for Databases” as its initial development predated MCP, but was renamed to align with recently added MCP compatibility.\nWhy Toolbox? Toolbox helps you build Gen AI tools that let your agents access data in your database. Toolbox provides:\nSimplified development: Integrate tools to your agent in less than 10 lines of code, reuse tools between multiple agents or frameworks, and deploy new versions of tools more easily. Better performance: Best practices such as connection pooling, authentication, and more. Enhanced security: Integrated auth for more secure access to your data End-to-end observability: Out of the box metrics and tracing with built-in support for OpenTelemetry. General Architecture Toolbox sits between your application’s orchestration framework and your database, providing a control plane that is used to modify, distribute, or invoke tools. It simplifies the management of your tools by providing you with a centralized location to store and update tools, allowing you to share tools between agents and applications and update those tools without necessarily redeploying your application.\nGetting Started Installing the server For the latest version, check the releases page and use the following instructions for your OS and CPU architecture.\nBinary Container image Compile from source To install Toolbox as a binary:\n# see releases page for other versions export VERSION=0.4.0 curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v$VERSION/linux/amd64/toolbox chmod +x toolbox You can also install Toolbox as a container:\n# see releases page for other versions export VERSION=0.4.0 docker pull us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/database-toolbox/toolbox/toolbox:$VERSION To install from source, ensure you have the latest version of Go installed, and then run the following command:\ngo install github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox@v0.4.0 Running the server Configure a tools.yaml to define your tools, and then execute toolbox to start the server:\n./toolbox --tools_file \"tools.yaml\" You can use toolbox help for a full list of flags! To stop the server, send a terminate signal (ctrl+c on most platforms).\nFor more detailed documentation on deploying to different environments, check out the resources in the How-to section\nIntegrating your application Once your server is up and running, you can load the tools into your application.

Installed and configured the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI). Authenticated with Google Cloud for Application Default Credentials (ADC): gcloud auth login gcloud auth application-default login Set your default Google Cloud project (replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your actual project ID): gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_ID Toolbox and the client libraries will use this project for BigQuery, unless overridden in configurations. Enabled the BigQuery API in your Google Cloud project. Installed the BigQuery client library for Python: pip install google-cloud-bigquery Completed setup for usage with an LLM model such as LangChain LlamaIndex ADK langchain-vertexai package.\nlangchain-google-genai package.\nlangchain-anthropic package.\nllama-index-llms-google-genai package.\nllama-index-llms-anthropic package.\ngoogle-adk package. Step 1: Set up your BigQuery Dataset and Table In this section, we will create a BigQuery dataset and a table, then insert some data that needs to be accessed by our agent. BigQuery operations are performed against your configured Google Cloud project.\nCreate a new BigQuery dataset (replace YOUR_DATASET_NAME with your desired dataset name, e.g., toolbox_ds, and optionally specify a location like US or EU):\nexport BQ_DATASET_NAME=\"YOUR_DATASET_NAME\" # e.g., toolbox_ds export BQ_LOCATION=\"US\" # e.g., US, EU, asia-northeast1 bq --location=$BQ_LOCATION mk $BQ_DATASET_NAME You can also do this through the Google Cloud Console.\nTip\nFor a real application, ensure that the service account or user running Toolbox has the necessary IAM permissions (e.g., BigQuery Data Editor, BigQuery User) on the dataset or project. For this local quickstart with user credentials, your own permissions will apply.\nThe hotels table needs to be defined in your new dataset for use with the bq query command. First, create a file named create_hotels_table.sql with the following content:\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_NAME.hotels` ( id INT64 NOT NULL, name STRING NOT NULL, location STRING NOT NULL, price_tier STRING NOT NULL, checkin_date DATE NOT NULL, checkout_date DATE NOT NULL, booked BOOLEAN NOT NULL ); Note: Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_DATASET_NAME in the SQL with your actual project ID and dataset name.\nThen run the command below to execute the sql query:\nbq query --project_id=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --dataset_id=$BQ_DATASET_NAME --use_legacy_sql=false \u003c create_hotels_table.sql Next, populate the hotels table with some initial data. To do this, create a file named insert_hotels_data.sql and add the following SQL INSERT statement to it.\nINSERT INTO `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_NAME.hotels` (id, name, location, price_tier, checkin_date, checkout_date, booked) VALUES (1, 'Hilton Basel', 'Basel', 'Luxury', '2024-04-20', '2024-04-22', FALSE), (2, 'Marriott Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-14', '2024-04-21', FALSE), (3, 'Hyatt Regency Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-20', FALSE), (4, 'Radisson Blu Lucerne', 'Lucerne', 'Midscale', '2024-04-05', '2024-04-24', FALSE), (5, 'Best Western Bern', 'Bern', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-01', '2024-04-23', FALSE), (6, 'InterContinental Geneva', 'Geneva', 'Luxury', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-28', FALSE), (7, 'Sheraton Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-27', FALSE), (8, 'Holiday Inn Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-09', '2024-04-24', FALSE), (9, 'Courtyard Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-03', '2024-04-13', FALSE), (10, 'Comfort Inn Bern', 'Bern', 'Midscale', '2024-04-04', '2024-04-16', FALSE); Note: Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_DATASET_NAME in the SQL with your actual project ID and dataset name.\nThen run the command below to execute the sql query:\nbq query --project_id=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --dataset_id=$BQ_DATASET_NAME --use_legacy_sql=false \u003c insert_hotels_data.sql Step 2: Install and configure Toolbox In this section, we will download Toolbox, configure our tools in a tools.yaml to use BigQuery, and then run the Toolbox server.\nDownload the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:\nTip\nSelect the correct binary corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.\nexport OS=\"linux/amd64\" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64 curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.4.0/$OS/toolbox Make the binary executable:\nchmod +x toolbox Write the following into a tools.yaml file. You must replace the YOUR_PROJECT_ID and YOUR_DATASET_NAME placeholder in the config with your actual BigQuery project and dataset name. The location field is optional; if not specified, it defaults to ‘us’. The table name hotels is used directly in the statements.\nTip\nAuthentication with BigQuery is handled via Application Default Credentials (ADC). Ensure you have run gcloud auth application-default login.\nsources: my-bigquery-source: kind: bigquery project: YOUR_PROJECT_ID location: us tools: search-hotels-by-name: kind: bigquery-sql source: my-bigquery-source description: Search for hotels based on name. parameters: - name: name type: string description: The name of the hotel. statement: SELECT * FROM `YOUR_DATASET_NAME.hotels` WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', @name, '%')); search-hotels-by-location: kind: bigquery-sql source: my-bigquery-source description: Search for hotels based on location. parameters: - name: location type: string description: The location of the hotel. statement: SELECT * FROM `YOUR_DATASET_NAME.hotels` WHERE LOWER(location) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', @location, '%')); book-hotel: kind: bigquery-sql source: my-bigquery-source description: \u003e- Book a hotel by its ID.

The Python agent examples in Step 3 (e.g., await toolbox_client.load_toolset(\"my-toolset\")) rely on a toolset named my-toolset. To make those examples work, you will need to add a toolsets section to your tools.yaml file, for example:\n# Add this to your tools.yaml if using load_toolset(\"my-toolset\") # Ensure it's at the same indentation level as 'sources:' and 'tools:' toolsets: my-toolset: - search-hotels-by-name - search-hotels-by-location - book-hotel - update-hotel - cancel-hotel Alternatively, you can modify the agent code to load tools individually (e.g., using await toolbox_client.load_tool(\"search-hotels-by-name\")).\nFor more info on tools, check out the Resources section of the docs.\nRun the Toolbox server, pointing to the tools.yaml file created earlier:\n./toolbox --tools_file \"tools.yaml\" Step 3: Connect your agent to Toolbox In this section, we will write and run an agent that will load the Tools from Toolbox.\nTip\nIf you prefer to experiment within a Google Colab environment, you can connect to a local runtime.\nIn a new terminal, install the SDK package.\nLangchain LlamaIndex ADK pip install toolbox-langchain pip install toolbox-llamaindex pip install google-adk Install other required dependencies:\nLangchain LlamaIndex ADK # TODO(developer): replace with correct package if needed pip install langgraph langchain-google-vertexai # pip install langchain-google-genai # pip install langchain-anthropic # TODO(developer): replace with correct package if needed pip install llama-index-llms-google-genai # pip install llama-index-llms-anthropic pip install langchain toolbox-langchain Create a new file named hotel_agent.py and copy the following code to create an agent: LangChain LlamaIndex ADK from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent # TODO(developer): replace this with another import if needed from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAI # from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI # from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver from toolbox_langchain import ToolboxClient prompt = \"\"\" You're a helpful hotel assistant.

MCP Toolbox for Databases is open-source and can be ran or deployed to a multitude of environments. For convenience, we release compiled binaries and docker images (but you can always compile yourself as well!).\nFor detailed instructions, check our these resources:\nQuickstart: How to Run Locally Deploy to Cloud Run Do I need a Google Cloud account/project to get started with Toolbox? Nope! While some of the sources Toolbox connects to may require GCP credentials, Toolbox doesn’t require them and can connect to a bunch of different resources that don’t.\nDoes Toolbox take contributions from external users? Absolutely! Please check out our DEVELOPER.md for instructions on how to get started developing on Toolbox instead of with it, and the CONTRIBUTING.md for instructions on completing the CLA and getting a PR accepted.\nCan Toolbox support a feature to let me do $FOO? Maybe? The best place to start is by opening an issue for discussion (or seeing if there is already one open), so we can better understand your use case and the best way to solve it. Generally we aim to prioritize the most popular issues, so make sure to +1 ones you are the most interested in.\nCan Toolbox be used for non-database tools? Currently, Toolbox is primarily focused on making it easier to create and develop tools focused on interacting with Databases. We believe that there are a lot of unique problems when interacting with Databases for Gen AI use cases, and want to prioritize solving those first.\nHowever, we’ve also received feedback that supporting more generic HTTP or GRPC tools might be helpful in assisting with migrating to Toolbox or in accomplishing more complicated workflows. We’re looking into what that might best look like in Toolbox.\nCan I use $BAR orchestration framework to use tools from Toolbox? Currently, Toolbox only supports a limited number of client SDKs at our initial launch. We are investigating support for more frameworks as well as more general approaches for users without a framework – look forward to seeing an update soon.\nWhy does Toolbox use a server-client architecture pattern? Toolbox’s server-client architecture allows us to more easily support a wide variety of languages and frameworks with a centralized implementation. It also allows us to tackle problems like connection pooling, auth, or caching more completely than entirely client-side solutions.\nWhy was Toolbox written in Go? While a large part of the Gen AI Ecosystem is predominately Python, we opted to use Go. We chose Go because it’s still easy and simple to use, but also easier to write fast, efficient, and concurrent servers. Additionally, given the server-client architecture, we can still meet many developers where they are with clients in their preferred language. As Gen AI matures, we want developers to be able to use Toolbox on the serving path of mission critical applications. It’s easier to build the needed robustness, performance and scalability in Go than in Python.\nIs Toolbox compatible with Model Context Protocol (MCP)? Yes! Toolbox is compatible with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP). Please checkout Connect via MCP on how to connect to Toolbox with an MCP client.\n","categories":"","description":"Frequently asked questions about Toolbox.","excerpt":"Frequently asked questions about Toolbox.","ref":"/genai-toolbox/about/faq/","tags":"","title":"FAQ"},{"body":"\nBefore you begin This guide assumes you have already done the following:\nInstalled Python 3.9+ (including pip and your preferred virtual environment tool for managing dependencies e.g. venv) Installed PostgreSQL 16+ and the psql client Step 1: Set up your database In this section, we will create a database, insert some data that needs to be access by our agent, and create a database user for Toolbox to connect with.\nConnect to postgres using the psql command:\npsql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres Here, postgres denotes the default postgres superuser.\nCreate a new database and a new user:\nTip\nFor a real application, it’s best to follow the principle of least permission and only grant the privileges your application needs.\nCREATE USER toolbox_user WITH PASSWORD 'my-password'; CREATE DATABASE toolbox_db; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE toolbox_db TO toolbox_user; ALTER DATABASE toolbox_db OWNER TO toolbox_user; End the database session:\n\\q Connect to your database with your new user:\npsql -h 127.0.0.1 -U toolbox_user -d toolbox_db Create a table using the following command:\nCREATE TABLE hotels( id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR NOT NULL, location VARCHAR NOT NULL, price_tier VARCHAR NOT NULL, checkin_date DATE NOT NULL, checkout_date DATE NOT NULL, booked BIT NOT NULL ); Insert data into the table.\nINSERT INTO hotels(id, name, location, price_tier, checkin_date, checkout_date, booked) VALUES (1, 'Hilton Basel', 'Basel', 'Luxury', '2024-04-22', '2024-04-20', B'0'), (2, 'Marriott Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-14', '2024-04-21', B'0'), (3, 'Hyatt Regency Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-02', '2024-04-20', B'0'), (4, 'Radisson Blu Lucerne', 'Lucerne', 'Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-05', B'0'), (5, 'Best Western Bern', 'Bern', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-01', B'0'), (6, 'InterContinental Geneva', 'Geneva', 'Luxury', '2024-04-23', '2024-04-28', B'0'), (7, 'Sheraton Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upper Upscale', '2024-04-27', '2024-04-02', B'0'), (8, 'Holiday Inn Basel', 'Basel', 'Upper Midscale', '2024-04-24', '2024-04-09', B'0'), (9, 'Courtyard Zurich', 'Zurich', 'Upscale', '2024-04-03', '2024-04-13', B'0'), (10, 'Comfort Inn Bern', 'Bern', 'Midscale', '2024-04-04', '2024-04-16', B'0'); End the database session:\n\\q Step 2: Install and configure Toolbox In this section, we will download Toolbox, configure our tools in a tools.yaml, and then run the Toolbox server.\nDownload the latest version of Toolbox as a binary:\nTip\nSelect the correct binary corresponding to your OS and CPU architecture.\nexport OS=\"linux/amd64\" # one of linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, or windows/amd64 curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/v0.4.0/$OS/toolbox Make the binary executable:\nchmod +x toolbox Write the following into a tools.yaml file.

This page walks though different types of telemetry and observability available in Toolbox.\nToolbox exports telemetry data of logs via standard out/err, and traces/metrics through OpenTelemetry. Additional flags can be passed to Toolbox to enable different logging behavior, or to export metrics through a specific exporter.\nLogging The following flags can be used to customize Toolbox logging:\nFlag Description --log-level Preferred log level, allowed values: debug, info, warn, error. Default: info. --logging-format Preferred logging format, allowed values: standard, json. Default: standard. Example:\n./toolbox --tools_file \"tools.yaml\" --log-level warn --logging-format json Level Toolbox supports the following log levels, including:\nLog level Description Debug Debug logs typically contain information that is only useful during the debugging phase and may be of little value during production. Info Info logs include information about successful operations within the application, such as a successful start, pause, or exit of the application. Warn Warning logs are slightly less severe than error conditions. While it does not cause an error, it indicates that an operation might fail in the future if action is not taken now. Error Error log is assigned to event logs that contain an application error message. Toolbox will only output logs that are equal or more severe to the level that it is set. Below are the log levels that Toolbox supports in the order of severity.\nFormat Toolbox supports both standard and structured logging format.\nThe standard logging outputs log as string:\n2024-11-12T15:08:11.451377-08:00 INFO \"Initialized 0 sources.\\n\" The structured logging outputs log as JSON:\n{ \"timestamp\":\"2024-11-04T16:45:11.987299-08:00\", \"severity\":\"ERROR\", \"logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation\":{...}, \"message\":\"unable to parse tool file at \\\"tools.yaml\\\": \\\"cloud-sql-postgres1\\\" is not a valid kind of data source\" } Tip\nlogging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation shows the source code location information associated with the log entry, if any.\nTelemetry Toolbox is supports exporting metrics and traces to any OpenTelemetry compatible exporter.\nMetrics A metric is a measurement of a service captured at runtime. The collected data can be used to provide important insights into the service. Toolbox provides the following custom metrics:\nMetric Name Description toolbox.server.toolset.get.count Counts the number of toolset manifest requests served toolbox.server.tool.get.count Counts the number of tool manifest requests served toolbox.server.tool.get.invoke Counts the number of tool invocation requests served toolbox.server.mcp.sse.count Counts the number of mcp sse connection requests served toolbox.server.mcp.post.count Counts the number of mcp post requests served All custom metrics have the following attributes/labels:\nMetric Attributes Description toolbox.name Name of the toolset or tool, if applicable. toolbox.operation.status Operation status code, for example: success, failure. toolbox.sse.sessionId Session id for sse connection, if applicable. toolbox.method Method of JSON-RPC request, if applicable. Traces A trace is a tree of spans that shows the path that a request makes through an application.\nSpans generated by Toolbox server is prefixed with toolbox/server/. For example, when user run Toolbox, it will generate spans for the following, with toolbox/server/init as the root span:\nResource Attributes All metrics and traces generated within Toolbox will be associated with a unified resource. The list of resource attributes included are:\nResource Name Description TelemetrySDK TelemetrySDK version info. OS OS attributes including OS description and OS type. Container Container attributes including container ID, if applicable. Host Host attributes including host name. SchemaURL Sets the schema URL for the configured resource. service.name Open telemetry service name. Defaulted to toolbox. User can set the service name via flag mentioned above to distinguish between different toolbox service. service.version The version of Toolbox used. Exporter An exporter is responsible for processing and exporting telemetry data. Toolbox generates telemetry data within the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), and user can choose to use exporters that are designed to support the OpenTelemetry Protocol. Within Toolbox, we provide two types of exporter implementation to choose from, either the Google Cloud Exporter that will send data directly to the backend, or the OTLP Exporter along with a Collector that will act as a proxy to collect and export data to the telemetry backend of user’s choice.\nGoogle Cloud Exporter The Google Cloud Exporter directly exports telemetry to Google Cloud Monitoring. It utilizes the GCP Metric Exporter and GCP Trace Exporter.\nNote\nIf you’re using Google Cloud Monitoring, the following APIs will need to be enabled:\nCloud Logging API Cloud Monitoring API Cloud Trace API OTLP Exporter This implementation uses the default OTLP Exporter over HTTP for metrics and traces. You can use this exporter if you choose to export your telemetry data to a Collector.\nCollector A collector acts as a proxy between the application and the telemetry backend. It receives telemetry data, transforms it, and then exports data to backends that can store it permanently. Toolbox provide an option to export telemetry data to user’s choice of backend(s) that are compatible with the Open Telemetry Protocol (OTLP). If you would like to use a collector, please refer to this Export Telemetry using the Otel Collector.\nFlags The following flags are used to determine Toolbox’s telemetry configuration:\nflag type description --telemetry-gcp bool Enable exporting directly to Google Cloud Monitoring. Default is false. --telemetry-otlp string Enable exporting using OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) to the specified endpoint (e.g. “http://127.0.0.1:4318”). --telemetry-service-name string Sets the value of the service.name resource attribute. Default is toolbox. In addition to the flags noted above, you can also make additional configuration for OpenTelemetry via the General SDK Configuration through environmental variables.\nExamples:\nTo enable Google Cloud Exporter:\n./toolbox --telemetry-gcp To enable OTLP Exporter, provide Collector endpoint:\n./toolbox --telemetry-otlp=\"http://127.0.0.1:4553\" ","categories":"","description":"An overview of telemetry and observability in Toolbox.","excerpt":"An overview of telemetry and observability in Toolbox.","ref":"/genai-toolbox/concepts/telemetry/","tags":"","title":"Telemetry"},{"body":"A tool represents an action your agent can take, such as running a SQL statement. You can define Tools as a map in the tools section of your tools.yaml file. Typically, a tool will require a source to act on:\ntools: search_flights_by_number: kind: postgres-sql source: my-pg-instance statement: | SELECT * FROM flights WHERE airline = $1 AND flight_number = $2 LIMIT 10 description: | Use this tool to get information for a specific flight. Takes an airline code and flight number and returns info on the flight. Do NOT use this tool with a flight id. Do NOT guess an airline code or flight number. An airline code is a code for an airline service consisting of a two-character airline designator and followed by a flight number, which is a 1 to 4 digit number. For example, if given CY 0123, the airline is \"CY\", and flight_number is \"123\". Another example for this is DL 1234, the airline is \"DL\", and flight_number is \"1234\". If the tool returns more than one option choose the date closest to today. Example: {{ \"airline\": \"CY\", \"flight_number\": \"888\", }} Example: {{ \"airline\": \"DL\", \"flight_number\": \"1234\", }} parameters: - name: airline type: string description: Airline unique 2 letter identifier - name: flight_number type: string description: 1 to 4 digit number Specifying Parameters Parameters for each Tool will define what inputs the agent will need to provide to invoke them. Parameters should be pass as a list of Parameter objects:\nparameters: - name: airline type: string description: Airline unique 2 letter identifier - name: flight_number type: string description: 1 to 4 digit number Basic Parameters Basic parameters types include string, integer, float, boolean types. In most cases, the description will be provided to the LLM as context on specifying the parameter.\nparameters: - name: airline type: string description: Airline unique 2 letter identifier field type required description name string true Name of the parameter. type string true Must be one of “string”, “integer”, “float”, “boolean” “array” description string true Natural language description of the parameter to describe it to the agent. Array Parameters The array type is a list of items passed in as a single parameter. To use the array type, you must also specify what kind of items are in the list using the items field:\nparameters: - name: preffered_airlines type: array description: A list of airline, ordered by preference. items: name: name type: string description: Name of the airline. field type required description name string true Name of the parameter. type string true Must be “array” description string true Natural language description of the parameter to describe it to the agent. items parameter object true Specify a Parameter object for the type of the values in the array. Authenticated Parameters Authenticated parameters are automatically populated with user information decoded from ID tokens that are passed in request headers. They do not take input values in request bodies like other parameters. To use authenticated parameters, you must configure the tool to map the required authServices to specific claims within the user’s ID token.\ntools: search_flights_by_user_id: kind: postgres-sql source: my-pg-instance statement: | SELECT * FROM flights WHERE user_id = $1 parameters: - name: user_id type: string description: Auto-populated from Google login authServices: # Refer to one of the `authServices` defined - name: my-google-auth # `sub` is the OIDC claim field for user ID field: sub field type required description name string true Name of the authServices used to verify the OIDC auth token. field string true Claim field decoded from the OIDC token used to auto-populate this parameter.
